<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-preface">Preface</h2>
<p>These are lecture notes for selected parts of the University Minor Economics course “Choices, Inequality, and Welfare” at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. These notes do not purport to have the same quality, scope, detail and ambition level of an established and published textbook, but rather provide a summary view. We point to reading elsewhere, so the reader can bridge gaps that we may leave, or find alternative exposition of similar material.</p>
<p>We focus on modeling aspects, cutting short on contextual stories. Such context is typically provided in principles-level texts. Economic modeling, on the other hand, tends to be heavy on the math (and stats) side, but we try hard to make things easy. We make extensive use of visualizations.</p>
<p>What we offer in these notes is partly new and experimental, in particular when it comes to graphical exposition. Our graphs make use of the graphing calculator available at <a href="https://desmos.com">desmos.com</a>.</p>
<p>Graphs or diagrams are visualizations of models. Consider a policy maker that wants to know how changing the excise tax rate on gasoline can change consumers’ choice of transport mode. Currently the excise tax is 80 cents, and it can be measured how much people drive in their cars and use their bicycles. A model can help making an informed prediction for scenarios that have not yet materialized, for instance an increase of the tax to 100 cents. The model may have a number of mathematical equations that depend on parameter values. In economics, model solutions are often (but not always) equilibria. Equilibria help making predictions about economic outcomes. Graphs show in many cases an exact model solution given concrete parameter values, such as the tax rate. Policy makers can then be conceived of being interested in and able to change those parameter values with the aim of influencing economic outcomes. Unlike the usual textbook readings where economic diagrams representing generic modeling aspects are shown as static examples, our graphs are based on parameterized models and based on particular mathematical specifications. Changing the parameter values gives you a direct quantitative idea on how the outcome of interest is predicted to change.</p>
<p>Graphs or diagrams are important in economics. What we add is, actually, quite cool.</p>
<p>In the words of economists Mark <span class="smallcaps">Blaug</span> and Peter <span class="smallcaps">Lloyd</span>,</p>

<p><q>In many areas of economic theory, the way in which economists understand economic concepts and propositions is through figures and diagrams.

<p>We believe that Desmos is particularly suited in very heterogeneous groups with students of vastly different backgrounds and technical skill sets. Much of Desmos is geared at middle school kids, this fact alone may give you an idea that it won’t be impossible to learn or to grasp. We also find it fast and very reliable, there are no set-up costs, nothing needs installing, there are no fees to be paid, and you can use many of its features without even logging in anywhere (and even that is easy and for free).</p>
<p>Our approach has the following advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>By offering concrete examples, we show you concrete model solutions, and partly also how they feed into a next stage of a layered model. For instance, once you know at stage 1 the solution to a consumer choice problem between car and bicycle use, you may want to know in stage 2 how the demand for car trips and bicycle trips changes with a change in the price of gasoline or in stage 3 how the individual decisions aggregate up to the market level.</li>
<li>Students can change the parameters and then understand, in a playful way, how such a model parameter affects the graph, without having to go through the math. Comparative statics then comes easy.</li>
<li>We believe playing with the Desmos examples is a highly intuitive and time-efficient way to grasp what are essentially mechanical aspects of an economic model. You’ll literally see the gears turn. A picture is worth a 1000 words, a moving picture perhaps a million.</li>
<li>Students that want to do the math are encouraged to solve a particular problem (say, an optimization problem where a consumer rationally chooses between two goods) and compare it with the offered Desmos solution. If all is well the answers will match and you have a good check of your own work.</li>
</ul>
<p>For these reasons, our approach has been awarded with the</p>
<ul>
<li>SBE Impact Lab Award 2022</li>
<li>Learn Academy BKO/SKO Alumni Fund Award 2023</li>
</ul>
<p>at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.</p>
<p>Of course, the approach may also have drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Readers will only see very specific examples. Economic theory, as developed and published in academic journals, goes far beyond such examples and characterizes solutions based on minimal mathematical assumptions (for instance, assumptions relating to convexity or differentiability of some function). Examples only offer limited insights, and not being aware of their limitations poses the danger of jumping to the wrong conclusion in slightly different contexts. In other words: pictures are no proof.</li>
<li>Students may not feel the urge to dig deep and understand the mechanics of economic models at a deeper level, and they may feel less encouraged to read books.</li>
</ul>
<p>These potential drawbacks notwithstanding, we hope that readers see the approach as complementing more abstract reading in economics, and apply the versatile toolset beyond course work. Even more so, we hope that reading textbooks gets easier when readers also can play along.</p>
<p>Our hope is that readers find what we offer here quite useful and have some fun along the way. Fun and economic theory hardly go together, but we try hard to make things accessible and digestible, especially for those that don’t have much of a knack for applied math. Students that want to go on and further specialize into economics (e.g., embarking a master’s program in economics), hopefully get encouraged to build a solid base.</p>

<p>These notes are much of a cookbook, showing examples, and serving as an overview. The flavor of it will be known from introductory courses. We illustrate, partly using “dynamic” (actually: comparative static) pictures that readers can manipulate directly, but we don’t require from students the mathematical or formal rigor that is found in intermediate level textbooks. Instead, we’re a cut below intermediate level, at something that may be appropriately categorized as intromediate (the term is borrowed from T. <span class="smallcaps">Cookson</span>).</p>
<p>However, readers are encouraged to have a look at our complementary math notes (<a href="https://edu.nl/atb7x" target="_blank"><em>Review of Some Useful Math</em></a>) that refresh some of the concepts we shall be using here.</p>
<p>What we cover here is a birds-eye view of a theoretical framework that took a century to develop, and we need to keep the exposition brief. Please consult good texts if you are to dig deeper or need more introduction.</p>
<p>Recommended textbooks that give a much better coverage are</p>
<ul>
<li>Hal <span class="smallcaps">Varian</span>, Intermediate Microeconomics.</li>

<p>The first two are standard microeconomics books. Students that prefer a good book may want to buy one of those. <span class="smallcaps">Nechyba</span> is a very good alternative with excellent pictures (almost as good as ours <span class="math inline">\(\ldots\)</span>). <span class="smallcaps">McAfee</span> et al.&nbsp;is a freely downloadable open source book, but some students may find the algebra more challenging.</p>

<p>Choices, utility, demand, and welfare, and all are core economics concepts that you have heard about before. We review some of this and bring it together for our purposes. We first briefly review choices, and we restrict ourselves to a choice of a consumer between different compositions of a consumption basket. That basket may contain fruit (apples, bananas, cherries, dates, etc.) or anything else that we assume has value. So, the analysis sets out with a description of preferences, introduces the notions of indifference curves and then moves on to a mathematical concept called the utility function. The latter ‘measures’ satisfaction of the consumer with any given consumption basket. This is <a href="#sec-prefs" class="quarto-xref">Chapter&nbsp;2</a>.</p>
<p>The next step is to bring resources into the picture, we focus on prices and incomes, both of which we take as given for the consumer. Prices and incomes are used to define a budget constraint under which the consumer makes her or his choices. Combining the information on the budget constraint with the information on preferences or utility, and assuming rational, optimal choice, allows us to derive the important relation between, on the one hand, quantity optimally demanded or consumed, and prices and income on the other hand. In particular, when we focus on one good and its price, and put those two variables on the axes of a graph, we speak of a demand curve (price typically on the vertical axis, quantity on the horizontal). This is <a href="#sec-demand" class="quarto-xref">Chapter&nbsp;3</a>.</p>
<p>The same section also explores a couple of other deviations that in some sense are about changes in income. One relates to the the relation between quantities demanded and income while keeping prices constant. So, in a diagram we would put income on one axis rather than a price and trace out the relation with quantity. Such a diagram is called an <span class="smallcaps">Engel</span> curve. We can learn from it how the demand reacts to changes in income and measure so-called income elasticities. These are statistics that tell us by how many per cent the quantity demand changes when we increase income by 1 per cent. It might be that demand decreases, stays constant, increases or strongly increases with income.</p>
<p>The other deviation explored in the same section relates to the definition of income itself. The static consumer choice diagram that is taught in foundational courses suggests that the relation between price and quantity is of interest and that income is given. But whose income is actually given in reality? Most consumers are also workers and they generate their own incomes by earning a wage. Others are subsistance farmers that grow crop that they can consume and whatever they don’t consume is brought to the market and traded for money income. The latter example really makes clear that some people have, as it were, an endowment they could sell. Indeed, almost everybody has some durables they could trade on the second-hand market. How about labor earnings? If you think about it, you’d realize you also have a time endowment. You can sell some of your time to an employer instead of consuming leisure. These two examples are essentially about chosen or, as economists prefer to say, endogenous, incomes. A third example relates to choices over time, between periods. Analytically, there is no substantial difference with the standard consumer choice model, once we make a distinction between consumption today and consumption tomorrow as the goods we want to focus on.</p>
<p>Variation in prices and/or incomes brings about variation in the budget constraint, and, by implication, variation in the optimally demanded quantities. At the same time, as the composition of the chosen consumption basket changes, the satisfaction level that the consumer experiences (or, optimally can experience) may change. Such variation in satisfaction level offers a first gauge at what we may call change in consumer welfare. We may actually prefer to measure welfare changes expressed in monetary (or money or dollar) terms, using the analytical framework of rational consumer choice. Once we know, for instance, how large a drop in welfare a consumer experiences, if all of a sudden the price for heating gas explodes, our framework opens a route for analyzing what type of compensatory payments a policymaker could suggest to help consumers that feel squeezed. This is <a href="#sec-welfare" class="quarto-xref">Chapter&nbsp;4</a>.</p>
<p>Economic analysis is very useful, apparently.</p>
<p>Markets bring together demand and supply, and similar to demand, supply can be derived from first principles. We’d be looking at profit maximizing firms and ask what is the best they can do when they buy inputs on some market (say, the labor market) and sell outputs on another, where outputs are obtained from using a given production technology. We also look at the trade-off between producing different goods when input supply is fixed. We keep that section brief and technical. It is <a href="#sec-supply" class="quarto-xref">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we may want to go back to the price system (<a href="#sec-demand" class="quarto-xref">Chapter&nbsp;3</a>), and aggregate demands across consumers. This gives us market demand. We can then combine market demand with market supply, to find the market equilibrium set of prices that clears all markets. We can then determine consumer and producer surplus as some aggregate measure of welfare in the market. This is <a href="#sec-equil" class="quarto-xref">Chapter&nbsp;6</a>.</p>
<p>There are a couple of more things that can be done, after having analyzed a single consumer. We can consider more than one consumer. Start with two, helping us model an embryonic society. We return to the analysis of <a href="#sec-prefs" class="quarto-xref">Chapter&nbsp;2</a> and consider the preferences of two consumers, if they face the problem how to allocate a given amount of quantities of all goods (10 apples, 6 bananas) between them. That is, each consumer is to have his or her own consumption basket, but the total quantities summed over both baskets is fixed. How to allocate the goods optimally? This is analyzed in the <a href="#sec-efficiency" class="quarto-xref">Chapter&nbsp;7</a> that introduces the graphical concept of an <span class="smallcaps">Edgeworth</span> box. We state that consumers can find, by direct interaction and haggling, a <span class="smallcaps">Pareto</span> efficient outcome that they cannot improve upon. Next to this type of exchange efficiency, there is allocative efficiency, that brings together the production with the consumption sphere.</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Pareto</span> Efficiency does not need market interaction, so it does not rely on a price system. Restricting social decisions in such a way that only <span class="smallcaps">Pareto</span> improvements were considered, is very conservative in the sense that consumers are allowed to veto all changes that hurt them. That would leave limited scope for redistribution, even though the approach respects consumer sovereignty. How about, we take an apple from one consumer and give it to the other, without compensation? Sounds like socialism, but may be the right thing to do, if we live in a society that judges such policies fair under certain circumstances. In fact, this happens all the time with the income tax (that tends to tax the rich progressively, and where the poor typically don’t pay taxes but are at the receiving end of the redistribution chain). Doing so is a big intellectual leap from the framework discussed before, and we try to make clear why. We end up with an optimal (at least in some sense optimal) social choice that maximizes social welfare. This is <a href="#sec-equitywelfare" class="quarto-xref">Chapter&nbsp;8</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, we reflect back on the implications of a market system for <span class="smallcaps">Pareto</span> efficient allocation and for social welfare optimality in <a href="#sec-markets" class="quarto-xref">Chapter&nbsp;9</a>. These are The Fundamental Theorems of Welfare Economics and The Second Best. Whereas the Fundamental Theorems allow the optimistic prediction that markets can efficiently allocate scarce resources in a way that also the government cannot improve upon, and that can implement any government-selected target allocation, the Second Best allows for a slightly more practical approach and realistic view.</p>

<h2 data-number="1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-overview"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> The Microeconomic Model: An Overview</h2>
<p>Much of what we have covered so far is summarized again in the diagram we present below in this section. The model sketched is much of a work horse model for theoretical underpinnings of economic policy making, and it can be generalized to many consumers, firms, goods, inputs, it can be generalized to take intertemporal decisions into account and risk or uncertainty. Yet, a couple of big issues are not covered, and they have much to do with market failure: deviations of real-world markets in terms of efficiency, or equity, that everyone is aware of, and that critics of the market mechanism will always point out.</p>
<p>The first area of policy concern relates to poverty and inequality. Clearly, the model so far does not promise much in terms of markets getting rid of poverty or reducing inequality, since political or philophical views are important. We cover in <a href="#sec-povineq" class="quarto-xref">Chapter&nbsp;10</a> how one might measure poverty and inequality in a statistical but also economically meaningful way, using data on income or consumption of individuals and households. This does require a bit of statistics background, and readers are advised to consult their statistics books on occasion. Our approach stays mainly graphical, however. We discuss things like <span class="smallcaps">Lorenz</span> curves, <span class="smallcaps">Gini</span> coefficients, and statistical poverty measures. We also touch on policies to change inequality and poverty outcomes. In particular, we consider simple income redistribution and policy options to help people getting out of poverty. The importance of the tax and transfer system will be stressed, which not only shifts resources from the rich to the poor, but also may give the wrong incentives to individuals to keep working and pay income tax.</p>
<p>The second area of policy concern relates to public goods and externalities. Those are very important concepts when trying to understand environmental pollution, international coordination, and combating climate change. We introduce public goods as goods that are non-excludable in use and non-rivalrous in consumption in <a href="#sec-expg" class="quarto-xref">Chapter&nbsp;11</a>. This means they can be used by anyone “for free” (no-one can be excluded to pay a usage fee or an entrance ticket) but they can also benefit everyone since usage of one person does not infringe upon the usage by other persons. The market will typcially not, or not adequately and not efficiently provide such goods. The problem gets deeper to solve when we consider transnational or global public goods that require international policy coordination. We know from following the news that such coordination is slow and incomplete. We show why. There is some hope, however, within the boundaries of a country to use policy instruments to reduce pollution or increase abatement through a pollution tax or an emissions rights market system. We explain the mechanics of such approaches.</p>
<p>The third area of policy concern relates to market power. The introductory model emphasizes the need for competitive behavior in order to achieve efficiency goals. Many industries are non-competitive, however, they have the possibility to charge mark-ups on top of marginal costs. Readers will be familiar with the standard monopoly model, and <a href="#sec-mktstruc" class="quarto-xref">Chapter&nbsp;12</a> also reviews it briefly, but then extends to cases where a monopoly is the best we can hope for, as there is no viable way to introduce competition (so-called natural monopolies). This calls for regulation as policy task of the government. If some limited form of competition can be introduced, we can study a model with two firms that compete. These are duopoly models that focus on strategic interaction and use game theoretic concepts. We consider price competition, and competition in quantities. Both these models have very different policy implications. Lastly, we consider a game in which firms move sequentially.</p>
<p>The fourth area of policy concern relates to risk and insurance. The economic modeling toolset allows to take into account rational decision making when inputs to or outcomes of a decision are uncertain. Modeling can advance under the assumption that the uncertainty can be quantified by means of statistical distributions. We introduce the notion of expected utility, and discuss what relation it has to preferences with respect to risk in <a href="#sec-riskins" class="quarto-xref">Chapter&nbsp;13</a>. Economic agents can be risk-averse or risk-loving, perhaps, and such preferences will drive the demand for insurance. We explain how a very simple insurance model works, and how it can achieve efficient allocation under risk. This is all good and well and might suggest that markets can take care of dealing with risk. But the real world is more complex, and part of the issues why insurance markets fail, or are perhaps even absent, have to do with asymmetric information. This means one party to a business deal knows more about essential aspects than another. The asymmetry will be exploited by the better-informed party, leading to market outcomes that are less than efficient or even fully inefficient. The institutional policy response is to set up social insurance systems that try to prevent the inefficiency to take hold.</p>

<p>Many markets do not appear to establish the close link between equilibrium outcomes and Pareto Efficiency, and hence fail to do what they should. Common reasons include</p>

<li>underprovided public goods</li>
<li>asymmetric information between parties</li>
<li>abuse of market power</li>
</ul>
<p>They entail violations of assumptions leading up to the 1st Theorem.</p>
<p>This failure also breaks the non-separability of equity and efficiency (2nd Theorem). Market outcomes are not <strong>First Best</strong> anymore, instead, there is a trade-off: society needs to choose among evils, and can reach at most <strong>Second Best</strong> outcomes.</p>

<p>Consumption choices are typically analyzed as the result of a decision where a consumer considers a set of available items<span>—</span>we call them consumption baskets or consumption bundles<span>—</span> and evaluates them in comparison according to her or his preferences. In <a href="#fig-cbundles" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2.1</a>, the red and the blue dot are two such consumption bundles, with indicated quantities of the two goods measured along the axes. If we are to predict whether the consumer prefers the red or the blue bundle, we would need to restrict the preferences (without a restriction, there is nothing we can say).</p>
<p>A natural starting point may be to say that both goods are “good” in the sense that the consumer likes them, so we may make the assumption that “more is better”. This can be illustrated using better-than sets (areas that contain consumption bundles that are better because they contain more units of at least one of the goods) for both goods.</p>

In other words, if you choose a starting point anywhere and go to the north-east, you’ll end up with a bundle that you prefer to staying put. You can also toggle the better-than-sets on and off to see this clearly.</p>

<p>We limit ourselves unnecessarily if we are to only consider two bundles in which one has more units than the other. We must also require that the consumer can compare situations in which, say, the blue dot lies to the north-west of the red dot, so there is an implicit trade-off between the two goods. We then need additional assumptions in order to describe the preferences and predict what the consumer will do. Before getting there, we need to assume that the consumer is able to compare any two bundles, no matter how much or little of any good they contain. This assumption is called <em>completeness</em>. Any two bundles can be ranked in terms of preference (better, worse, same).</p>
<p>In addition, we require certain consistency in choice, in particular we assume <em>transitivity</em>. Consider three bundles, A, B and C. If the consumer likes A better than B, and B better than C, then we want to conclude that she or he also likes A better than C. For if not, the consumer might cycle forever between the bundles, or, if choice is made sequentially (A vs.&nbsp;B, then B vs.&nbsp;C), the choice would depend on the order in which the comparisons are being presented, and the choice would be revised once we check back (C vs.&nbsp;A). Choices would then be intransitive. We rule this out by assumption.</p>

<p>They seem to be reasonable and relatively mild assumptions, but it is easy to get real consumers puzzled once you actually present them with (real or hypothetical) choices. Consumer rationality implies that the consumer can make an internally consistent choice for herself, under any circumstances.</p>

<p>On to more assumptions. The “more is better (or at least not worse)” assumption discussed above is called <em>monotonicity</em> (and sometimes authors prefer to refer to non-satiation or local non-satiation, meaning you’ll never have enough, one cookie more is always preferred to not-one-cookie-more). It is sort of intuitive that this is a stronger assumption than the rationality assumptions (at some stage, that extra cookie does make you feel queasy).</p>
<p>Another often-made assumption is that of <em>convexity</em>, meaning mixtures of bundles are preferred to non-mixtures of bundles. You can try to get a feel for what this entails by looking at <a href="#fig-3cbundles" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2.2</a> and considering whether it makes sense to prefer the green dot (that has 50% of all quantities of A and of B) rather than the blue or the red dot. You may also deviate from the 50:50 mixture by moving the green slider.</p>
<p>Lastly, we may want to assume that consumer satisfaction from consumption bundles does not change drastically if we change the content of the basket only very slightly (i.e., a crumble more, as opposed to a whole cookie). This assumption is called <em>continuity</em>.</p>

<p>From the five underlying assumptions we can derive indifference curves. These are all combinations of bundles that give the same level of satisfaction. Take a look at <a href="#fig-icconvex" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2.3</a>. Start with two points in which the consumer prefers A to B. Then change the composition of one of the points so she prefers B to A. In between, there will be a position where, despite A and B having different compositions, the consumer really cannot tell which bundle is better. In that case, she is indifferent between A and B. We can conceive of many such points when we consider all types of bundles, and connect the ones for which the consumer is indifferent. We might end up with a picture like this that shows indifference between the numbered bundles 1 through 5.</p>
<p><a href="#fig-icconvex" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2.3</a> also illustrates the convexity assumption, as point F is really a mixture of bundles 2 and 4. Whereas the consumer is indifferent between bundles 2 and 4 (and 1, 3, and 5), point F will be preferred to any of them. This can be seen from considering bundle 3 and invoking the monotonicity assumption (more is better): F will be (strictly) preferred to 3.</p>

<p>The shown points are just 5 examples, and they all have in common that the consumer has the same satisfaction level. We can consider a second set of points, in <a href="#fig-icmap" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2.4</a> in red, that among them also yield the same level of satisfaction and hence are on an indifference curve of their own. When we compare the blue and the red curve, we see that the red is to the north-east of the blue, so we can always consider movements from a blue point in the north-east direction to some point on the red curve. As north-east means more of both <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, we prefer the red point to the blue, owing to monotonicity.</p>

<p>The previous subsections showed consumption bundles as combination of (physical) quantities of different goods. In our figure these were the dots. We compared them using some valuation that we related to the term satisfaction. What mattered was whether satisfaction with one bundle was higher than, lower than, or about equal to the satisfaction with another bundle. We could go a step further and ask: what if we could express the level of satisfaction numerically, with a higher (numerical) valuation indicating a higher level of satisfaction? We could then label the various bundles by that valuation. This is what <a href="#fig-iclevel" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2.5</a> does.</p>

<p>Mapping out indifference curves using pairwise comparisons of consumption bundles is a cumbersome process. With a little imagination and mathematics we can simplify the procedure. First, a definition: a <em>utility function</em> is a mathematical function that represents consumer preferences. It attaches to each consumption bundle a numerical value of a satisfaction level, which we shall call utility henceforth. We entertain the convention that a higher number of utility means a higher level of satisfaction. This is, in fact, just what <a href="#fig-iclevel" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2.5</a> did. And in <a href="#fig-3cbundles" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2.2</a>, we could attach utility value of, say “5” to the blue indifference curve, and some higher value, say “7” to the red one. This is actually all we need to say. We rank indifference curves and ranking only means utility goes up towards the north-east between the indifference curves. Whether the number associated with the red curve is actually “7” or “6” or “5.00000001” or “8746237839” is immaterial, as long as the ranking is preserved.</p>
<p>As a mathematical function, the utility function has as arguments (inputs) the quantities on the axes of our graph, and we write it as <span class="math inline">\(u(x,y).\)</span> That is, function <span class="math inline">\(u()\)</span> returns a value based on the measurements of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.</p>
<!-- Two Column Setup _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ -->
<div class="grid">
<div class="g-col-6">
<p>Here is an example of a utility function <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\label{eq:u1}
u(x,y) = 0.5 x + 0.5 y
\end{equation}\]</span> and an indifference curve at utility level 1 could be written <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\label{eq:u2}
u(x,y) = 1.
\end{equation}\]</span> This second equation is an implicit function of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. It means: define all values of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> for which utility <span class="math inline">\(u(x,y) = 0.5 x + 0.5 y\)</span> is equal to 1.

<p>For a utility function defined for two consumption goods <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, <span class="smallcaps">Cobb Douglas</span> specifies <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cd}
u(x,y) = x^{\alpha}\ \cdot\ y^{1-\alpha}.
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>The <span class="smallcaps">Cobb Douglas</span> function has one free parameter <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> that determines the shape of indifference curves.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <a href="#fig-iccd" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2.7</a> shows a set of indifference curves and you can play around with the picture by moving the slider.

To aid understanding, we have color-coded the curves, giving the higher levels of utility a darker hue.</p>
<p>A variation is obtained after taking natural logarithms on both sides (denoted <span class="math inline">\(\ln()\)</span>):<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

Hence, just from looking at <a href="#fig-iccd" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2.7</a> we cannot tell whether the utility function in <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:cd}\)</span> or in <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:cd2}\)</span> applies.</p>
<p>The CD function is an easy one. It only has a single parameter <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> in our specification, and is simple to manipulate algebraically.

<p>The CES function is more complex, as it has two free parameters <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> that determine the shape of indifference curves. <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ces}
u(x,y) = \left(ax^{\frac{s-1}{s}}+(1-a)y^{\frac{s-1}{s}}\right)^{\frac{s}{s-1}}.

<p>Parameter <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> signifies the consumption share between goods <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, whereas <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is the curvature (or bendiness) of the indifference curves. This latter parameter is particularly interesting. Unlike the <span class="smallcaps">Cobb Douglas</span> function, where the indifference curves are of the same shape type and can only tilt, the CES allows getting towards two extremes: perfect substitutability (if parameter <span class="math inline">\(s\to \infty\)</span>) and perfect complementarity (when <span class="math inline">\(s\to 0\)</span>). <a href="#fig-icces" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2.8</a> invites you to play and confirm that you can generate many more shapes of indifference curves than in the CD case.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is a constant and known as the “elasticity of substitution”, hence the name of the CES function. This term describes mathematically the ease at which a consumer is willing to incur small changes in the composition of the consumption basket without leaving the current indifference curve (i.e., while keeping utility constant). In principle, an elasticity is a local concept.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> The fact that this elasticity is constant simply means it has the same value anywhere on an indifference curve.</p>

<p>The CD function also has a constant elasticity of substitution, which is always equal to 1.

<p>Indeed, with values of <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> in the vicinity of 1, our two figures suggest the indifference curves could be the same.

<h2 data-number="2.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-utility3D"><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> The Mathematical Utility Function in 3D</h2>
<p>Specifying a mathematical function <span class="math inline">\(u(x,y)\)</span> to obtain a (set of) indifference curve(s) is a very powerful idea. It condenses a point-by-point description of indifference relations to a single and typically short mathematical expression. Consider infinitely many utility levels, that are all captured by this single expression. This seems very efficient, indeed. We say that the utility represents the preferences between bundles, but in practice we proceed as if they were the same (and not just with the same level of preference).</p>
<p>An expression like this (again involving the natural logarithm <span class="math inline">\(\ln{()}\)</span>): <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\label{eq:uln}
u(x,y) = \ln{(x)} + \ln{(y)}
\end{equation}\]</span> is a 3-dimensional object, since we have 2 input variables and one output variable (the utility number). Hence, the indifference curve map is actually nothing but a 2-dimensional representation of the 3-dimensional utility function. Very similar to a topographic hiking map with elevation contours. 3D objects are harder to graph, however, certainly with pen and paper. That’s one reason why you almost never see them in economics, except here.</p>

<h2 data-number="2.6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-ordinal"><span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> Levels: Cardinal and Ordinal Utility</h2>
<p>Utility values reflect the level of satisfaction, to some degree. Yet, even though higher values of utility mean more satisfaction, there is no intrinsic meaning to the levels themselves. A hiking map gives you an indication that you are on 1,000m above sea level, and moving to 1,100m means you’re measurably higher up by 100m. Conversely, going from utility level 5 to 10 does not mean satisfaction has doubled. It just got higher. There is also no origin. So, we could start measuring utility at <span class="math inline">\(-5,000\)</span> and go to <span class="math inline">\(-4,999\)</span> to find we have improved.</p>
<p>This property that only ranking matters but not the level and scale is because the measurement is <em>ordinal</em> and not <em>cardinal</em> (as with height, temperature or speed). We don’t need cardinal utility, at least not here. This is important to keep in mind.</p>
<p>Ordinality also implies that, once we work with a utility function, we can subject that function to all kinds of monotonic transformations. A monotonic transformation entails that we use utility as an argument inside a function that preserves the ranking but not the numerical values of valuations associated with a given consumption bundle.</p>

<p>Suppose the utility function is <span class="math inline">\(u(x,y) = \sqrt{x\cdot y}\)</span>, then one monotonic tranformation can be multiplication by 2: <span class="math display">\[v(x,y) = 2\cdot u(x,y) = \sqrt{4\cdot x\cdot y}.\]</span> <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> just returns a larger number than <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>, for any combination of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.

<p>Since there are many ways to produce the same ranking using different scales, we may also want to realize that it will be difficult if not impossible to compare preferences directly between people. Our modeling approach does not assume that we can do so.</p>

<p>Let’s go back to the more familiar 2D case. The utility function has all the information in it that is needed to fully describe preferences, and can easily be used to construct indifference curves. Indifference curves, on the other hand, are fundamental for economic analysis. We can characterize indifference curves by their shapes, possibly in words, and once we know the functional form of utility, also in terms of their mathematical properties. For instance, we can look at their slopes. The axioms of choice imply that indifference curves are weakly downward falling (<em>weakly</em> meaning they could be horizontal), at a nonincreasing rate. So, we know that indifference curves must have a negative (or zero) slope, and that they get flatter (or stay constant) as we increase the number of units of one of the goods. See <a href="#fig-iccd" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2.7</a> and <a href="#fig-icces" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2.8</a> for CD and CES preferences.</p>
<p>In economic terms, the slope of the indifference curve tells us how much of one good (say, good <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, perhaps measured along the vertical axis of our diagram) the consumer is <em>willing to give up</em> in exchange for one marginal unit of the other good (say, good <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, measured along the horizontal axis), while staying indifferent to the trade. After all, since we move along the indifference curve, utility stays unchanged. Importantly, while accepting such a trade, the consumer substitutes between <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.</p>

Definition&nbsp;2.1: Marginal Rate of Substitution
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>In mathematical terms, the slope of an indifference curve is known as the <em>marginal rate of substitution</em> (MRS). The MRS can be defined as the first derivative of the indifference curve if we define an indifference curve as an explicit function relating <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. The MRS can also be defined as the ratio of partial derivatives of the utility function: <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mrs}
MRS(x,y) = \left.\frac{MU_x}{MU_y} \right. = \left.\frac{\frac{\partial u(x,y)}{\partial x}}{\frac{\partial u(x,y)}{\partial y}}.\right.
\end{equation}\]</span> Here, <span class="math inline">\(MU_x\)</span> is the <em>marginal utility</em> of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, that is, the partial derivative of <span class="math inline">\(u()\)</span> with respect to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The MRS includes the two key words <em>marginal</em> and <em>substitution</em>. Marginal, because we consider very small (calculus jargon: infinitesimally small) changes, and substitution because we replace one good with another. The first expression in <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:mrs}\)</span> writes the MRS as the ratio of marginal utilities <span class="math inline">\(MU_x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(MU_y\)</span>, that is, how utilities change when we give the consumer an extra miniscule quantity of good <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> (or, of good <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>). The second expression writes those marginal utilities as partial derivatives. The MRS is then a function of both <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. In general, the MRS is a local concept, meaning that it is impacted by where we are on an indifference curve.</p>
<p>The MRS is a core concept in economics. It is a measure of willingness to give up, of how much quantity of one good the consumer is willing to relinquish in exchange for more of another good. With our continuous and convex indifference curves, consumers are always willing to trade a bit of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, the only question is, how much of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is needed so that they stay exactly on their original indifference curve.</p>
<p>Let us close with an example based on <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:uln}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:usqrt}\)</span>.</p>

<p>Utility maximization directly results in consumption demand. Maximized utility yields optimal quantities demanded, when prices <span class="math inline">\(p_x, p_y\)</span> and income <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> are given. So, mathematically, we write <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\label{eq:umaxproblem}
\max_{x,y}\;u(x,y) \quad \text{s.t.} \quad p_x\cdot x+p_y\cdot y = m
\end{equation}\]</span> which reads: maximize utility by choosing <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> such that expenditure <span class="math inline">\(p_x\cdot x+p_y\cdot y\)</span> equals income <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. The latter (s.t.) is a constraint. In economic terms we call this a <em>budget constraint</em>, stipulating that consumers cannot spend more than the income they have. They could however spend less. This will not make much sense in our model since there is no future and hence no need for saving for tomorrow. On top of that, under the ‘more is better’ assumption, fully exhausting the given budget is a necessary condition for achieving a level of utility that is as high as possible (for if there was a dollar left to spend, it better be spent on commodity units that increase utility).</p>
<p>If we solve the mathematical problem <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:umaxproblem}\)</span>, we get demand functions <span class="math inline">\(D_x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D_y\)</span> that relate the quantities demanded of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> to the underlying parameters: <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\label{eq:demx}
x = D_x(p_x, p_y, m)
\end{equation}\]</span> and <span class="math display">\[y = D_y(p_x, p_y, m).\]</span> These are optimally chosen quantities demanded by a rational, utility-maximizing consumer, when prices and income are given.</p>

<p>There are many ways to solve this problem in practice.

\label{eq:bc}
p_x\cdot x+p_y\cdot y = m,
\end{equation}\]</span> solve the latter for quantity <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[y = \frac{m-p_x\cdot x}{p_y},\]</span> and plug this expression into <span class="math inline">\(u(x,y)\)</span> to find a (new) function with only quantity <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> as its argument, <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\label{eq:usqrt1}
u(x) = \sqrt{x \cdot \frac{m-p_x\cdot x}{p_y}}.
\end{equation}\]</span> This way, we have incorporated the budget constraint and got rid of variable <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. Function <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:usqrt1}\)</span> is illustrated in <a href="#fig-constrained" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;3.1</a>.</p>

Exercise&nbsp;3.2: Square Root Utility and General Case
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>The square root utility is one special case of the <span class="smallcaps">Cobb Douglas</span> family. Insert <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=\frac{1}{2}\)</span> into equation <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:cd}\)</span> to see this clearly. Further exploration will show that the <span class="smallcaps">Cobb Douglas</span> parameter <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> in general has an interpretation as the budget share that goes to good <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Intuition can be gained by going back to <a href="#fig-iccd" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2.7</a> and shifting <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> to its extremes (0 or 1). Do this, and explain why what you see is consistent with an extreme budget share.</p>
<p>If you feel up to it, use algebra (and perhaps calculus) to see if you can solve the optimization problem and derive that <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> equals <span class="math inline">\(p_x \cdot x^\star/m\)</span>. Your solution <span class="math inline">\(x^\star\)</span> will be a function of <span class="math inline">\(p_x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p_y\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, and terms should cancel out.</p>

<p>The next step is to vary the price <span class="math inline">\(p_x\)</span>—this changes the value of the budget constraint and hence the function <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:usqrt1}\)</span>, and we would need to reoptimize. In <a href="#fig-constrained" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;3.1</a>, this is easy to do: slide the <span class="math inline">\(p_x\)</span> slider. Then find that the optimal <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> decreases when increasing <span class="math inline">\(p_x\)</span>. This helps tracing out the relation between <span class="math inline">\(p_x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, known by its popular name <em>demand function</em>.

<h2 data-number="3.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-redux"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Optimization Redux</h2>
<p>An alternative approach to maximizing utility is to consider a figure like <a href="#fig-3D" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2.9</a> again and realize that the straight line has all the features of a budget constraint constructed using prices <span class="math inline">\(p_x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p_y\)</span>, and income <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. Its (absolute) slope is the relative price ratio: <span class="math inline">\(\frac{p_x}{p_y}.\)</span></p>
<!-- Two Column Setup _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ -->
<div class="grid">
<div class="g-col-6">
<p>In the optimum, the slope is equal to the MRS, that is the slope of the indifference curve, since the latter is tangent to (just touches) the constraint. So, we can claim that in the optimum the following must hold <span class="math inline">\(MRS = \frac{p_x}{p_y}.\)</span></p>
<p>We now use <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:mrs}\)</span> and write <span class="math inline">\(\frac{MU_x}{MU_y} = \frac{p_x}{p_y},\)</span> rewritten once again as <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\label{eq:muxismuy}
\frac{MU_x}{p_x} = \frac{MU_y}{p_y}.
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>This latter formulation may be familiar as it says that the real-valued marginal utilities between consumption goods need to be equalized, or, using an example, that the last dollar spent on apples must increase your utility to the same extent as spending the last dollar on bananas. For if not, you would be better off allocating the last dollar to the good that promises a higher marginal utility.</p>
<p>Recall that <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:muxismuy}\)</span> is just one set of conditions: there are many combinations of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> that comply with the requirement. However, with a <em>given budget constraint</em> only one of them actually applies. In other words, we still need to combine the optimality condition <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:muxismuy}\)</span> with the budget constraint <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:bc}\)</span> to arrive at the full solution. This is a matter of applying a little algebra.</p>

Conversely, if you were to change <span class="math inline">\(p_y\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, a new graph of <span class="math inline">\(D_x(p_x)\)</span> would be required: a parameter that is not measured along one of the axes may ‘shift’ the entire graph.</p>

<p>It is customary to depict the graph of <span class="math inline">\(x = D(p)\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> on the vertical axis and <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> on the horizontal.

<p>To construct such a graph from first principles, we first construct a consumer choice diagram with indifference curves and a budget constraint, at some initial price ratio, with price of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> at some concrete value of <span class="math inline">\(p_x^1\)</span>.

Consumers not only go to the shop and buy goods—they also sell. They may have a used bicycle they sell on the second hand market or some old furniture they trade on ebay. Analytically, we can treat this very similarly to what we’ve done so far, once we realize that the value of goods the consumer is equipped with<span>—</span>called an <em>endowment</em><span>—</span>is equal to the price-weighted sum of the possessions.
</p>
<p>
Denote the endowment quantities of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(x^e\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y^e\)</span>, respectively, then <span class="math inline">\(p_x\cdot x^e+p_y\cdot y^e\)</span> is the money value of items already belonging to the consumer. They can be added to the money income <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and the budget constraint. Comparison with equation <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:bc}\)</span> will then yield <span class="math display">\[p_x\cdot x+p_y\cdot y = m+p_x\cdot x^e+p_y\cdot y^e\]</span> or, alternatively, <span class="math display">\[p_x\cdot (x-x^e)+p_y\cdot (y-y^e) = m.\]</span>
</p>
<p>
The consumer will sell some of the good she or he has relatively plenty of (giving rise to <span class="math inline">\(x-x^e&lt;0\)</span>), compared to the optimal choice, and use the proceeds to buy more of the good she or he has comparatively little of (implying <span class="math inline">\(y-y^e&gt;0\)</span>).

We have assumed that the price of something you sell on the (second-hand) market is the same as the price you would have to pay for the same (or a very similar) item on the market.

One important difference will emerge when making a picture: with an endowment point, a budget constraint will pass through that endowment. <a href="#fig-endowment" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;3.4</a> illustrates, with <span class="math inline">\((x^e, y^e)\)</span> inserted as a red dot.

<h2 data-number="3.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-piecewise"><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Piecewise-Linear Budget Constraint</h2>
<p>To reiterate, we have just assumed that the price of something you sell on the (second-hand) market is the same as the price you would have to pay for the same (or a very similar) item on the market. This involves just a little change of notation without substantive complication.</p>
<p>However, often things sold fetch different prices than things bought, for various reasons. Buy a new car, drive it for a mile and sell it, you’d have to accept a huge discount. Lend your bank $10,000 and earn 1% on it per year, but borrow the same amount from the same bank and pay 10% in interest per annum. Such differences suggest that the prices depend on the direction in which you leave your endowment point. <a href="#fig-piecewise" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;3.5</a> shows a number of budget contraints with an endowment point (red circle) that are constructed with a price difference (wedge) between buying and selling. The budget constraint is then piecewise linear, with a kink at the endowment. Note, however, that we can also conceive of piecewise linear constraints whose kink points are not endowments.</p>

<p>Mathematically, such kinks are points of nondifferentiability, implying our simple calculus based on <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:muxismuy}\)</span> is inapplicable. Mathematical economists have algorithms ready that take such difficulty into account, but since we focus on diagrams, we can get intuition on how to proceed from the picture.</p>

</div>

<p>The left diagram in <a href="#fig-piecewise" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;3.5</a> has a convex budget set (the set underneath the constraint), with a flatter arm to the left and a steeper one to the right of the kink. The MRS is higher than the relative price everywhere on the left arm. The MRS is lower than the relative price everywhere on the right arm. Depending on the shape of the indifference curve, it could happen that an indifference curve just touches the constraint in its differentiable part, then the usual mathematical approach goes through. But it is quite possible that the kink, since it sticks out, is actually the optimal solution, simply because the kink point is on a higher indifference curve than any of the other feasible points on the constraint. And in the end, what matters for rational choice is the level of utility.</p>
<p>The middle diagram in <a href="#fig-piecewise" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;3.5</a> has a non-convex budget set. Here, indifference curves are such that the kink is on a lower level of utility than some points to the left or to the right of it. Hence, the kink point is not optimal and will not be chosen. Instead, the indifference curve and constraint are such that two optimal points can be found, giving rise to an ambiguity known as multiple equilibria. This makes actual choice hard to predict. At each of the optimal points, the marginal condition will hold.</p>
<p>The right diagram in <a href="#fig-piecewise" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;3.5</a> has a non-convex budget set with two kinks, one of them convex, the other non-convex. Indifference curves are such that the convex kink is associated with the highest level of utility among all feasible points. But note that only a small perturbation of the slopes of the budget constraint or the location of the convex kink could lead to choice jumping to an interior point on the left arm of the budget constraint where the marginal condition holds.</p>

<h2 data-number="3.6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-labor"><span class="header-section-number">3.6</span> Labor Supply</h2>
<p>One of the markets where endowments really matter is the market for labor. In this case, your endowment is the time you have at your disposal (24 hours, every day of the week). You can literally sell this time on the market against a wage.</p>
<p>The intuition can be had from <a href="#fig-labor" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;3.6</a>, where we have the quantity of a consumption good on the vertical axis and leisure (measured in hours) on the horizontal axis. Leisure time and consumption increase utility.</p>
<p>The endowment point is the point <span class="math inline">\((T_{max},0)\)</span>; that is, consuming leisure can be done maximally at <span class="math inline">\(T_{max}\)</span> hours a day, with the consumption endowment equal to zero. The consumer values leisure and despises work, but can be made to work if it allows for higher consumption possibilities. Labor supply (measured in hours) equals whatever is left of time after having chosen leisure, that is, <span class="math inline">\(T_{max}-\)</span>leisure hours.</p>
<p>The consumption good on the vertical axis has a price of 1, so we forget about it. The (absolute value of the) slope of the budget constraint going through the endowment point is then <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>, which denotes the hourly wage rate. This is really the opportunity cost of leisure: an hour not worked costs you 10$ if your wage rate is 10$. The true cost of Netflix is not the monthly subscription fee, but the foregone income.</p>

<p>The shape of the shown indifference curves is quite different from the previously shown <span class="smallcaps">Cobb Douglas</span> and CES cases.

<p>Further note that the optimal level of utility is colored green in <a href="#fig-labor" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;3.6</a>. This level will change as we change <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>. Hence, it looks as if the indifference curve were moving, but that’s not quite true.

<p>One of the additional insights that the labor supply model offers is that incomes (labor earnings) are also chosen, and not just a given parameter (as was <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> in our previous model). In this view, prices are more fundamental than incomes to a consumer, and incomes result from optimal choices given prices (including the wage rate).</p>

<p>Demand for a particular good is a function of all prices and income (and sometimes of endowments). This helps us predict how a rational consumer’s demand will change once we alter any of the parameters. Some of the parameters shift through changing market conditions, like certain goods getting more expensive, and some parameters shift through economic policy (income tax, or taxes on specific goods, for example). Analyzing such changes in our <em>static</em> model is called <em>comparative statics</em>, since it compares outcomes in static equilibria. We now change income and prices.</p>

<h2 data-number="4.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-engel"><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Income Shifts and Engel Curves</h2>
<p>Changing incomes is most straightforward when analyzing the effect on demand. We obtain so-called <span class="smallcaps">Engel</span> curves that give us a relation between consumption demand and income. Importantly, the relation is the same as our optimized function we looked at earlier, <span class="math display">\[x = D_x(p_x, p_y, m)\]</span> but now we keep <span class="math inline">\(p_x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_y\)</span> fixed and only vary <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. So, we might as well write: <span class="math display">\[x = D(m).\]</span> In many cases, higher incomes are associated with higher consumption. So, we can do the comparative statics by changing the value of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and draw the <span class="smallcaps">Engel</span> curve in a diagram that collects the optimal <span class="math inline">\(x,m\)</span> combinations (with quantity and income on the axes).</p>
<p>Using <span class="smallcaps">Engel</span> curves can be insightful if consumption of specific expenditure categories is considered. For instance, it will be interesting for policy to be informed about the relation between income and food consumption. Calculating the budget share spent on food and plotting it against income may give rise to <span class="smallcaps">Engel</span>’s Law, an empirical regularity showing that the food share decreases with income. That means, whereas households with low incomes may spend absolutely less on food than households with middle or high income, the low income earners spend more relatively. This is because food consumption is one of the first needs that households have to address, purely to meet nutritional requirements.</p>

<p>Characterizing <span class="smallcaps">Engel</span> curves in terms of their generic properties (increasing, decreasing, etc.) can be done locally using the concept of <em>elasticity</em>. This elasticity is a statistic (or number) that tells us by how many percent demand changes when we increase income by 1 percent. We can define it by considering discrete or continuous changes (favoring calculus, we prefer the continuous case):<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

Recall that demand for good <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is simply <span class="math display">\[x = \frac{\alpha}{p_x}\cdot m\]</span> to understand that Engel curves have no intercept and a constant slope (for given price <span class="math inline">\(p_x\)</span>). This is because demand is strictly proportional to income. Hence, consumption increases linearly in income <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. The income elasticity is constant as well, since when applying our formula, we find <span class="math display">\[\eta^D_m(x) = \frac{\alpha}{p_x} \cdot \frac{m}{\frac{\alpha}{p_x}\cdot m} = 1.\]</span></p>
<p>With a CES utility, we also would find that demand is strictly proportional to income, and Engel curves are again linear and go through the origin. Hence, the income elastity is 1. This implies that all goods under standard Cobb Douglas or CES preferences are normal, but neither necessities nor luxuries (as defined in <a href="#tbl-incomeel" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;4.1</a>).</p>

<h2 data-number="4.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-effects"><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Income and Substitution Effects of Price Changes</h2>
<p>Changing prices is a little less straightforward when analyzing the effect on demand. First, there are many prices to consider (at least two in our model). We can change any of them, but let’s focus on changing <span class="math inline">\(p_x\)</span> when analyzing the effect on the quantity demanded <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Second, there are two effects on the demand for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> from a change in <span class="math inline">\(p_x\)</span>. Consider a situation when restaurant food gets more expensive. Then (a) consumers have lower purchasing power, real incomes decrease; that’s the income effect discussed before (but now due to a price change); and (b) restaurant food becomes relatively more expensive compared to other goods, so consumers might substitute away and allocate their money differently (for instance, eat more at home); that is the substitution effect. Income and substitution effects may go in the same, or in the opposite direction.</p>
<p><a href="#fig-incsubeffects" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;4.1</a> shows a consumer choice diagram and gives an example of income and substitution effects for the quantities of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> when the price <span class="math inline">\(p_x\)</span> doubles. The underlying utility function is a <span class="smallcaps">Cobb Douglas</span> specification. The chosen bundle before the price change is point A, after the price change point B, and C is a virtual point that helps clarify how to determine income and substitution effects.</p>

<p>The substitution effect when moving away from A is obtained after applying a virtual (dashed) budget contraint with the new set of prices and being tangential to the indifference curve on which A is located. This gives a new optimal point C. The substitution effect is the change in quantity associated with this change, and since we have two goods, we could consider substitution effects in the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> or in the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> direction. We focus on <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
<p>The income effect then asks: what drop in income from the dashed line brings us to the new solid line (where we choose point B)? The income effect is the change in quantity associated with this loss of purchasing power.</p>
<p>Those two effects are marked on the horizontal axis as IE and SE, respectively. In the shown picture, they go in the same direction, and the total effect of the price change is the sum of both. The relative price increase makes the consumer substitute away from <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> along the original indifference curve through A and C, and the loss of purchasing power leads to additional reduction of demand for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>

<h2 data-number="4.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-utilchanges"><span class="header-section-number">4.5</span> Utility Changes</h2>
<p>
Relative price changes like those analyzed before, change the optimally chosen point and the level of utility that is maximally attainable. In <a href="#fig-incsubeffects" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;4.1</a>, this can be seen from the utility level lables on the indifference curves. We can measure the change in satisfaction, welfare or well-being as the difference in that maximally attainable level of utility (i.e., price goes up, utility goes down).
</p>
<p>
There are two problems. The first is that utility is not observable to a policy maker, it is only known to the individual (if at all). The second problem is that with ordinal utility, that is also not comparable between people, there would be no good basis for making welfare statements were we to look directly at utility changes.
</p>
<p>
Instead, economists have taken to look at changes in budgets. Budgets are in principle observable, and budget changes can be interpreted as being indicative of changes in welfare. If a relative price change can be undone in utility terms by a lump-sum payment of money from the government, say, then the size of that payment can be interpreted as being proportional to the change in welfare. What we would need to know from the consumer is at what point he or she feels indifferent between the before-price-change choice and the after-price-change-and-lump-sum-payment choice. Knowing the numerical utility value is then unimportant.

<h2 data-number="4.6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-compensating"><span class="header-section-number">4.6</span> Compensating Variation and Compensated Demand</h2>
<p>We now turn to measuring welfare changes expressed in money terms. If you look at the intersection points of the budget constraint in a consumer choice diagram, they are equal to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{m}{p_x}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{m}{p_y}\)</span> (as you set either <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(y=0\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:bc}\)</span>). Let’s focus on the vertical intercept, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{m}{p_y}\)</span>, and let’s renormalize the price of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> to be <span class="math inline">\(p_y=1\)</span>, always. Then, the size of the budget <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is equal to the vertical coordinate on the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> axis.</p>
We use the apparatus of <a href="#sec-effects" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;4.4</a> to measure welfare changes. In particular, consider an increase in <span class="math inline">\(p_x\)</span>, which makes the budget set smaller. The vertical intercept is not affected, but the budget constraint gets steeper.
<p></p>
<p>If we reconsider the mental exercise of splitting the price effect into a substitution and an income effect, we recall that the income effect can be obtained from an outward shift of the actual budget constraint after the price change to a budget level that affords the same level of utility as before the price change (when moving from B to C in <a href="#fig-incsubeffects" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;4.1</a>). This compensation payment to restore utility to its original value is called a <em>compensating variation</em> of income. It does not undo the price change, it only restores the utility level. Whereas we can imagine that a policy maker initiates such a compensation, we can also consider it to be a hypothetical change that does not actually happen.</p>
<!-- Two Column Setup _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ -->
<div class="grid">
<div class="g-col-6">
<p>How much is this in money terms? It is equal to the vertical difference between the after-price-change budget constraint intercept and the compensated budget constraint intercept. This is illustrated in <a href="#fig-compensating" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;4.2</a>, which is based on <a href="#fig-incsubeffects" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;4.1</a>. You can read off the amount of the compensating variation (CV) along the vertical axis. If you do the math, you can calculate it exactly given the model specification.</p>
<p>In other words, we do the same as with the income effect, but instead of focusing on how the demanded quantity changes when income changes, we focus on the income change itself. Denote the budget before and after the price change by <span class="math inline">\(m_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m_1\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_m = m_0-m_1 \lt 0\)</span> is the <em>money-metric</em> change in welfare that the consumer experiences from the price change, unless it is compensated with actually making sure the consumer would get <span class="math inline">\(m_1\)</span>. In our example, this welfare change is negative: when prices go up, welfare goes down.</p>

<p>Put differently again, the compensating variation equals (the negative of) the sum of money that the consumer would be just willing to accept from the policy maker in order to allow the price change to take place (if we were to think that the policy maker were in control of the price change, or was otherwise required to make compensation payments, perhaps for electoral reasons).

<p>These notes focus on consumer decisions and consumer welfare as main ingredients of economic models. However, we briefly sketch the rudimentary approach to modeling firms: employers that pay workers to transform their labor input into an output, and sell that output on the market with the aim of maximizing their profit.</p>
<p>We will first briefly look at describing a production technology before considering production possibilities of many outputs with a given amount of inputs. Then, we illustrate, in the simplest of cases, the problem of the maximization of profit, measured in dollars, and expressed as the difference between sales revenue (in dollars) and (monetized) production cost. We then derive the supply decision of a competitive firm.</p>

<p>Readers will probably be familiar with the concept of a production function. It embodies a relation between (physical units of) input <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> that is being transformed by the firm into an output <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>. Input is a catch-all term, and is often referred to as <em>production factor</em>. In many economic models, <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> denotes labor (hours of work) or units of (physical) capital, such as machinery.</p>
<p>In the simplest case, we write generically <span class="math display">\[q = f(z).\]</span></p>
<p>Note two things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>the relation is a technical one, and hence is frequently being referred to as <em>technology</em>;</li>
<li>the relation embodies the (physical) maximum of output that can be produced with a given amount of input; less can be produced, but technological efficiency requires to produce as much as possible, given input quantities.</li>
</ol>
<p>A production function can have many shapes, often we assume that more input leads to more technically feasible output, so <span class="math inline">\(f(z)\)</span> is monotonically increasing in <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>. The canonical case that is often assumed is that of a strictly <em>concave</em> function <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span> which is characterized by decreasingly positive increments. In <a href="#fig-prod" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;5.1</a>, an example is displayed in the upper left panel as the solid red line.</p>

<p>An important related concept is marginal productivity or the marginal product, <span class="math inline">\(MP\)</span>.

Remark&nbsp;5.2: Returns to Scale
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>A concave production function (on the left in <a href="#fig-prod" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;5.1</a>) is sometimes said to have <strong>decreasing returns to scale</strong>—the higher the total level of production, the fewer extra units can be produced from employing one more unit of input. A convex production function (on the right in <a href="#fig-prod" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;5.1</a>) then has <strong>increasing returns to scale</strong>—big is really beautiful (if beauty is a measure of production activity): at larger levels of input, it gets easier to produce extra output.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In case there is more than one production factor needed to produce the single output, say, two factors <span class="math inline">\(z_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z_2\)</span>, we write <span class="math display">\[q=f(z_1,z_2).\]</span> This expression is a three-dimensional object. The concave case would yield a shape very similar to the one of the 3-dimensional utility surface in <a href="#fig-3D" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2.9</a>. The level curves in the context of production would be known as <em>isoquants</em>, i.e., curves of input combinations of <span class="math inline">\((z_1,z_2)\)</span> that yield the same level of output <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>. Economists often use the same type of mathematical specifications for production functions, and hence isoquants, as for utility functions and indifference curves, and hence <a href="#fig-iccd" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2.7</a> and <a href="#fig-icces" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2.8</a> can be used to model the shape of isoquants, too.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we could understand the curve in <a href="#fig-prod" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;5.1</a> as being conditional on a given value of <span class="math inline">\(z_2\)</span> (if <span class="math inline">\(z_1\)</span> was on the horizontal axis). The dotted curves in the upper and lower left panels of <a href="#fig-prod" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;5.1</a> would then relate to some higher value of <span class="math inline">\(z_2\)</span>. This illustrates that more of <span class="math inline">\(z_2\)</span> increases the marginal productivity of <span class="math inline">\(z_1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Production functions feature in microeconomic models, and likewise in aggregate, macroeconomic models. For instance, aggregate production functions may describe sector-specific technologies.</p>
<p>In such aggregate relations, it is often of interest to consider the consequence of taking into account a limitation on the physical availability of input quantities. Consider the case of two outputs <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, produced with a single input <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>, and sector-specific technologies (<span class="math inline">\(f_x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f_y\)</span> — so these functions could be different from one another): <span class="math display">\[x=f_x(z)\]</span> <span class="math display">\[y=f_y(z).\]</span> Now let’s consider that the total stock of <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is fixed at <span class="math inline">\(\bar{z}\)</span>: this implies that whatever input quantity <span class="math inline">\(z_x\)</span> is used in production process <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, will be unavailable as input for <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. Hence, we have a physical restriction <span class="math display">\[\bar{z}=z_x+z_y\]</span> or, <span class="math display">\[z_y=\bar{z}-z_x\]</span> which acts as a constraint. We then can write <span class="math display">\[x=f_x(z_x)\]</span> <span class="math display">\[y=f_y(\bar{z}-z_x).\]</span></p>
<p>In other words, the fixed supply of input links the production of both goods in a physical way. To see this mathematically, you can solve both equations for <span class="math inline">\(z_x\)</span> and then equate the resulting expressions to find the relation between <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. The total production possibilities are constrained and cannot grow indefinitely. This establishes a trade-off in the production and we need to choose between <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.</p>

<p><a href="#fig-ppf" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;5.2</a> shows an example. The trade-off in production is the red curve in the NE quadrant.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>In order to understand this shape, assume that the production functions <span class="math inline">\(f_x(z)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f_y(z)\)</span> are concave.

This is the constraint on labor input, namely that only a fixed number of workers are available, whom we can use in the production of either <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(\bar{z}=z_x+z_y\)</span> must hold. Let us assume that point <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> (and its twins <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>) is the initial point of production. In the NE quadrant, we obtain point <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. Subsequently, we reallocate some labor away from <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and use it to produce more of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. We can do this in the picture by sliding the green dot <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> <em>along</em> the constraint. As a consequence, we slide not only <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> but also <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>.</p>
<p>This exercise can be conducted for all possible uses of labor in the production of either <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, enabling us to trace out the concave production possibility frontier PPF in the NE quadrant. The PPF shows how produced units of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> are technically transformed into units of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>: move some workers out of the production of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(z_x\downarrow\)</span> and have them work in sector <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, such that <span class="math inline">\(z_y\uparrow\)</span>, while keeping the overall number of workers in the economy constant at <span class="math inline">\(\bar z\)</span>. For this reason, the PPF is also referred to as the <em>transformation function</em>. Note that any point in the set below the PPF can be achieved as well, but that would not be technically efficient.</p>

<p>The marginal change (how many units of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> can we produce when we give up producing one unit of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> at the margin?) is called the <em>marginal rate of transformation between <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, MRT</em>. The more of good <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> we wish to produce, the more costly it becomes in terms of giving up units of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>: additional units of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> will need more inputs than preceding units (because of the concavity of our production functions—we say that returns to scale are decreasing, compare <a href="#nte-RTS" class="quarto-xref">Remark&nbsp;5.2</a>), and that means that increasingly more units of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> will need to be sacrificed to produce one additional unit of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. Hence, MRT is decreasing as we move away from <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> towards <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> (the production possibility frontier becomes ‘flatter’). It also implies that expanding production in one direction is associated with opportunity costs, since something has to give.</p>

Remark&nbsp;5.3: PPF and Comparative Advantage in International Trade

<p>Readers may have heard of production possibilities in the context of international trade. What our PPF in <a href="#fig-ppf" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;5.2</a> illustrates is a reflection of available technology and resources in a specific economy. Some other country may have a very differently shaped PPF, in which case it may make some sense to move production to the location where the opportunity cost of doing so are relatively low, in particular when trade in itself is costless (frictionless).</p>

<h2 data-number="5.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-cost"><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Cost of Output</h2>
<p>When a firm employs labor <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> (measured in hours) and pays for those hours according to the going wage rate <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> (per hour), its dollar outlays are <span class="math inline">\(w\cdot z\)</span>, so the product of price and quantity for the input.</p>
<p>The technological relation discussed in <a href="#sec-prod" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;5.1</a> can now be used to construct the cost of output function by way of combination with the money outlay <span class="math inline">\(w\cdot z\)</span>. We <em>invert</em> the production function to substitute out <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> for a function of <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>:<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> <span class="math display">\[q=f(z)\quad \Longrightarrow \quad z=f^{-1}(q)\equiv g(q)\]</span> and plug it into outlays to get the cost of output function <span class="math inline">\(C(q)\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[w\cdot z = w\cdot g(q) \equiv C(q).\]</span></p>
<p>In other words, the cost of output function is the scaled inverse of the production function. Whatever technological change helps the firm to squeeze more <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> out of a given amount of <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> will bring its cost down with a factor of <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>. Note, as elsewhere in these notes: perhaps it is more accurate to write <span class="math inline">\(C(q,w)\)</span> to be reminded of the fact that input prices will determine cost. In what follows, the relevant argument is <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>, however.</p>
<p>Once we have the cost of output function, we can define the concept of marginal cost as the marginal change in cost when producing additional output. Again, we use the mathematical derivative: <span class="math display">\[MC(q)=\frac{\mathrm{d}C(q)}{\mathrm{d}q} = C'(q).\]</span></p>

Remark&nbsp;5.4: Marginal Cost and Marginal Product
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>It is of interest to note that there is not only a direct relationship between production and cost function in this simple 1-input case, but also between the marginal cost and the marginal product.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In addition, if there are cost components that the firm cannot influence through variation of inputs, then we denote those as fixed costs. We use the symbol <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>. Fixed costs are relevant where the firm has two inputs but can only change one (say, labor), and has to take the level of the other input (say, capital) as given. In that case, the associated outlays (for capital) are fixed. The outlays associated with the variable input will give rise to variable cost, <span class="math inline">\(VC(q)\)</span>, that vary with the production level.</p>
<p>Fixed cost are also relevant when studying average cost. The latter are generally defined as the ratio of total production cost at production level <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> in relation to that production level: <span class="math display">\[AC(q)=\frac{C(q)}{q}.\]</span></p>
<!-- Two Column Setup _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ -->
<div class="grid">
<div class="g-col-6">
<p>If cost can be split into variable and fixed cost, we can write: <span class="math display">\[AC(q)=\frac{VC(q)}{q}+\frac{F}{q}.\]</span> Here, <span class="math inline">\(F/q\)</span> can be denoted <span class="math inline">\(AFC\)</span>, for average fixed cost. Suppose, <span class="math inline">\(VC(q)\)</span> is a linear function of output, as in: <span class="math display">\[VC(q)=b\cdot q,\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is a constant; then: <span class="math display">\[\frac{VC(q)}{q} = b,\]</span> which is constant and independent of <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>. It actually equals marginal cost in this example.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(F/q\)</span>, on the other hand, is hyperbolic. This is simply because the fixed cost will have to be incurred by the firm even when it produces very little. A firm with substantial fixed cost that does not produce much will have average cost being rather high. The more the firm produces, the lower is the influence of the fixed cost on the average cost.</p>

Remark&nbsp;5.5: Input Substitution
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Similar to a consumer’s substitution between ingredients of a consumption bundle, a firm may use several inputs in production (and most firms do), and find that it can substitute between them to achieve the same level of output at different input combinations. See our remarks on isoquants earlier in <a href="#sec-prod" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;5.1</a>. In that case, the firm would first try to find the optimal combination of inputs that, at given input prices, delivers the target level of output at the smallest expense. We don’t need this complication in our short exposition and will skip it. But it is good to be aware of the fact that input substitution can deliver additional cost saving.</p>

<h2 data-number="5.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-profit"><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Profit Maximization</h2>
<p>The goal of any firm is to make money. Maximization of profit means the firm chooses its output level <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> such that the difference between sales revenue <span class="math inline">\(R(q)\)</span> and cost <span class="math inline">\(C(q)\)</span>, denoted <span class="math inline">\(\Pi(q)\)</span>,<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> is as large as possible. Mathematically we write: <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\label{eq:profit}
\max_q \Pi(q) = R(q) - C(q).
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>There are a couple of restrictions on the problem to make it meaningful. First, profits should not go negative, else the firm better stops: <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\label{eq:profit0}
\Pi(q) \ge 0.
\end{equation}\]</span> Conversely, <span class="math inline">\(\Pi(q) &lt; 0\)</span> (loss) triggers firm exit because whatever the firm does returns less than it could earn if it were to use its capital equipment and human capital in alternative ways (in other words: as much as all economic costs are opportunity costs, negative profits are indicative of having better opportunities elsewhere). Second, sales may be constrained by market demand, producing units that no one wants to buy makes little sense: <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\label{eq:qdemand}
q \le D(p).
\end{equation}\]</span> Third, the firm is constrained by its technology, which is given. This fact is, however, already incorporated in <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:profit}\)</span> since <span class="math inline">\(C(q)\)</span> reflects to an important degree the production function.</p>
<p>To solve the problem in <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:profit}\)</span>, we need to look at the first order condition of maximization, which sets the first derivative of profit equal to zero. We obtain <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\label{eq:MRMC}
MR(q)-MC(q)=0.
\end{equation}\]</span> This gives us an <em>implicit</em> equation in <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>, and hence determines the optimal level of <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> that the firm wants to supply. <span class="math inline">\(MR(q)\)</span> stands for marginal revenue. <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:MRMC}\)</span> basically says: find that <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> that equates marginal cost and marginal revenue.</p>
<p>Subsequent models, in the following subsection and in <a href="#sec-mktstruc" class="quarto-xref">Chapter&nbsp;12</a> distinguish between various configurations of market structure and show that in particular the marginal revenue function differs between those configurations. We start with the case of a perfectly competitive firm.</p>

<h2 data-number="5.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-compsupply"><span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> Supply of a Competitive Firm</h2>
<p>For a perfectly competitive firm, <span class="math inline">\(MR(q)\)</span> equals the price: the firm takes the price as given, but is unrestricted by demand and <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:qdemand}\)</span> is not binding: the firm can, as long as <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:profit0}\)</span> holds, supply infinitely much.</p>
<p>Starting with the definition of revenue, differentiating and using <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:MRMC}\)</span> we obtain <span class="math display">\[R(q) = p\cdot q \quad \Longrightarrow \quad MR(q) = \frac{\text{d}R(q)}{\text{d}q} = p \quad \Longrightarrow \quad p-MC(q)=0.\]</span> The latter implies marginal cost pricing, or perhaps better, adjusting output choice such that marginal cost equals the given price. Note that <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:profit0}\)</span> then implies: <span class="math display">\[
p\cdot q - C(q)\ge 0 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad p\ge \frac{C(q)}{q} = AC(q),
\]</span> such that production at level <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> only occurs if the price covers average cost and the firm at least breaks even (makes zero profit).</p>
<p>The given parameter in the entire problem is the market price. Hence, a competitive firm’s supply function <span class="math display">\[q=S(p)\]</span> depends on the price. The quantity that the firm supplies is determined by marginal cost: the firm will choose a quantity such that its marginal cost equals the given market price, under the condition that the quantity is equal to or exceeds its minimum efficient scale (defined below). Hence, the supply function is basically the upward-sloping part of the marginal cost function as long as the price exceeds average cost. If this is not the case (firm makes losses), supply is zero (firm exits).</p>

<p>It is intuitive to illustrate with <a href="#fig-compsupply" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;5.4</a>. Assume we have linearly increasing marginal cost, fixed cost, and hence an average cost function that first falls steeply, and then turns around and increases as in <a href="#fig-avgcost" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;5.3</a>. The <span class="math inline">\(MC\)</span> curve intersects the <span class="math inline">\(AC\)</span> curve in its minimum. The level of output corresponding to that intersection point is known as the <em>minimum efficient scale</em> (denoted <span class="math inline">\(q^{mes}\)</span> in <a href="#fig-avgcost" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;5.3</a>). The firm needs to produce in that minimum or above. The market price is given, by assumption of facing a competitive firm. Since profit maximization entails to increase output beyond the minimum efficient scale to the point where the increasing <span class="math inline">\(MC\)</span> curve equals the given price at the green hollow dot, profit can be depicted as the orange reactangle: quantity times average profit (price minus average cost).</p>

<p>If the quantity demanded at the market level by all consumers exceeds the quantity supplied by all firms, then the price for that good should go up to reduce consumers’ demand and to reward firms for increasing supply. If the quantity demanded falls short of supply at the market level, then the price needs to fall, so as to ration the firms and incentivize consumers to want more of the good. Of course, we would need to have some deus ex machina that implements the price adjustment (who is to change the price if the price is really given to everyone?). Let’s assume we had such a price maker who calls out prices to which individual agents adjust.</p>

<p>The price maker can then find the equilibrium set of prices <span class="math inline">\(p_x^\star,p_y^\star\)</span> that makes the consumption and production plans of consumers and firms consistent with one another, such that on all markets the total quantity demanded equals the total quantity supplied and the markets clear simultaneously: for market <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[D_x(p_x^\star,p_y^\star)=S_x(p_x^\star,p_y^\star)\]</span> and for market <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[D_y(p_x^\star,p_y^\star)=S_y(p_x^\star,p_y^\star).\]</span> For clarity, we have put a subscript on the market demand and supply functions for the two goods. Mathematically, this is a system of two equations in two unknowns.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>One last remark is in order that we have not discussed before: we use separate notations for quantities demanded (<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>) and quantities produced or supplied (<span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>). The reason for doing so is to make clear that consumers and producers make purchasing and sales decisions independent of one another. We have earlier denoted aggregate demand as <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, and will now denote aggregate supply as <span class="math display">\[Q=\sum_j^M q_j = \sum_j^M S_j(p)\]</span> if there are <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> firms in the market to supply the same product. The equilibrium condition for market clearing is then <span class="math display">\[X=Q.\]</span> We keep the symbol <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> on the horizontal axis of our graph.</p>
<p>Market clearing on a market for a particular good thus determines the good’s price, which will feed back into the individual decisions at the micro level (<a href="#sec-demand" class="quarto-xref">Chapter&nbsp;3</a>, <a href="#sec-prod" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;5.1</a>). If you think of “the market” as a system of many markets of individual goods and inputs, then considering a single market in isolation will be referred to as <em>partial equilibrium</em> analysis, whereas considering many markets simultaneously, one may talk of <em>general equilibrium</em> analysis. Then, a general equilibrium is a set of prices leading to <em>simultaneous</em> market clearing of all markets in the system.</p>

<h2 data-number="6.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-macroagg"><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Macroeconomic Aggregates and Income Distribution</h2>
<p>There is another aspect. It may be easier to measure prices and quantities at the market or macroeconomic level, perhaps simply because statistics are available to do so. The question then is, whether the microeconomic exercise adds up in such a way that it is easy to interpret in terms of macroeconomic data. Since the relation between <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> has been derived from first principles at the micro level, a foundation for macroeconomic models that work with a ‘representative agent’, some average-type-of-guy who is meant to be typical for the economy, would be very useful.</p>
We have not taken into account incomes, however. Perhaps it is tempting to write aggregate demand at the national (or market) level as <span class="math display">\[X = D(p,\overline{m})\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\overline{m}\)</span> is average income in the country (or market), or some other aggregate (like GDP per capita). The aggregation just described overlooks the fact that demands are really given in expression <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:demx}\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[x_i = D_i(p_x, p_y, m_i).\]</span> Going on to write <span class="math display">\[X = \sum_i^N D_i(p_x, p_y, m_i)\]</span> shows that market demand depends through the individual demand functions on all individual incomes and hence on the entire income distribution. If individual demand functions are nonlinear in <span class="math inline">\(m_i\)</span>, it is unlikely that average income is a good proxy for the actual income distribution that we need. Strictly speaking, we should not say that market demand depends (only) on average income in society.

<p>Recall our <a href="#sec-compensating" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;4.6</a> on the compensating variation. With it, we are not forced to express welfare changes in utility terms, but instead use dollar values. We could also take the next step and consider many consumers, all of whom are affected by the price change. Even if every consumer has their own specific utility function and preferences, since we have translated the welfare change into a money metric, we can add up the changes across consumers and obtain an aggregate value of welfare change at the market level or a measure of aggregate willingness to pay. This is part of cost-benefit analyses and often done in applied economics (is it worth building a new dam, airport, road or train station, compared to the cost?).</p>

<div class="grid">
<div class="g-col-6">
<p>If, instead of focusing on the aggregated compensated variation, we use the perhaps somewhat more familiar concepts of consumer and producer surplus, we can study shifts in the market demand function and their consequences for the change in surpluses. The <a href="#fig-surplus" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;6.3</a> offers such a possibility. Consumer surplus (CS) is shaded green, producer surplus (PS) is blue. In competitive equilibrium, total surplus, the sum of CS and PS, is maximized. Total surplus is a measure of <span class="smallcaps">Paretian</span> welfare.</p>
<p>Be reminded that the market demand schedule reflects the marginal willingness to pay of consumers and the market supply schedule reflects marginal cost of production. In the market clearing equilibrium we have that the last unit sold costs as much to produce as the last consumer is willing to pay for it. This is our intuitive notion of efficiency. Another way of putting this is to say that the marginal benefits must equal marginal cost at the market level,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mb=mc}
MB=MC.
\end{equation}\]</span> Any deviation from this condition is either not feasible (<span class="math inline">\(Q&gt;Q^\star\)</span>) because extra units could not be profitably sold to consumers, or it would forgo opportunities of producing units cheaply while people are willing to pay more for them than firms need to cover their marginal cost, <span class="math inline">\(Q&lt;Q^\star\)</span>.</p>

<p>Be also reminded, again, that the traditional surplus analysis, or change in surplus analysis, will typically be partly driven by income effects on the demand side (<a href="#sec-compensating" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;4.6</a>). For a normal good (positive income effect), increasing prices would result in a larger welfare change when measured by the compensating variation than when measured by the change in consumer surplus.</p>

<p>Because of this restriction on overall resources, we can actually draw the two diagrams for persons A and B into a single graph: we simply flip the indifference curve diagram for person B around by 180<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span> and superimpose it on the graph for A.

<p>Can we make either person happier by reallocating resources and choosing a different point than the endowment? The answer is: generally, yes.</p>
<p>Consider the indifference curve for person A going through the endowment point E. All points above (north-east) that curve are clear improvements.

<p>If you do this, you will see that there are points where both persons improve: it is a lens-shaped area with the endowment point on one of its corners. So, if both individuals were to agree to swap units of their possessions so that they move from the endowment point to the interior of the lens, both will increase their utility.</p>
<p>Since we want to assume that people trade only when they are not being made worse off, we know that if we make one person better off, we must not make the other one worse off. That is, the other person must stay at least on his or her initial indifference curve through E (otherwise, he or she would refuse to trade). Say, we fix the level of utility for person A. This means that we move <em>along</em> his or her indifference curve. We can keep doing this while improving person B’s utility, without making A worse off. Such an improvement is called a <span class="smallcaps">Pareto</span> improvement (named after Italian economist Vilfredo <span class="smallcaps">Pareto</span>, 1848–1923). We can also cast this appealing to the notion of one allocation being <span class="smallcaps">Pareto</span> preferred over another:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The implication of being able to identify <span class="smallcaps">Pareto</span> improvements, is that mutual gains from trade can be realized. In plain language, these are win-win situations. How far can we go? That’s the domain of <span class="smallcaps">Pareto</span> efficiency:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>In other words, when agents A and B keep searching for mututal improvements, in the limit, all possibilities for <span class="smallcaps">Pareto</span> improvement will be exhausted, and no further improvements are possible anymore. That’s our intuitive notion of efficiency.</p>
<p>To see this in the box of <a href="#fig-Edgeworth" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;7.1</a>, if we keep moving away from the endowment point along A’s initial indifference curve, we will reach a point where we cannot further improve B’s utility. This is where both persons’ indifference curves are just tangential. Here, both individuals’ indifference curves have the same marginal rate of substitution, the same slope (see <a href="#sec-mrs" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;2.7</a>). <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mrsaismrsb}
\mathrm{MRS}^A = \mathrm{MRS}^B.
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>Once we are in such a point where the MRS of both consumers are the same, we cannot improve anyone’s situation without making the other person worse off. Such allocations are called <span class="smallcaps">Pareto</span> efficient: no-one can be made better off, unless we make at least one person in the economy worse off.</p>
<p>Recall that the marginal rate of substitution is the rate at which, say person A, is willing to give up units of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> in receipt for one extra unit of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>; similar for B. Therefore, at a point of <span class="smallcaps">Pareto</span> efficiency, where the tangency condition holds, A is prepared to give up as much of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> as B would need to get of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> as compensation when one unit of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> changes hands from B to A.</p>

If you reset the endowment point in <a href="#fig-Edgeworth" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;7.1</a> to its initial position, you may realize that only a small segment of that <em>contract curve</em> will be considered by individuals that trade voluntarily. These are the points between the two persons’ indifference curves going through point E, or the points on the contract curve that are also in the green set of <span class="smallcaps">Pareto</span> improvements. All other points outside that lens-shaped area will not qualify since trade starting from E will be blocked by at least one of the agents (since they’d lose). Allocations that will not be blocked are said to be in the <em>core</em> of the economy. This is the thick segment of the contract curve in <a href="#fig-Edgeworth" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;7.1</a>.</p>

<p>Equipped with a definition of <span class="smallcaps">Pareto</span> improvements and <span class="smallcaps">Pareto</span> efficiency, we can now move on to a welfare criterion for society. We could say that trade should happen (note the normative wording) whenever <span class="smallcaps">Pareto</span> improvements are possible. Conversely, trades should not happen where such improvements cannot be had. In other words, we allow social change in terms of who commands of what resources only for cases where at least one person gets better off, and no-one else loses. This is the Paretian welfare criterion, and it is solely based on voluntary trade. It is fully individualistic since all we do is to assess individual utility improvements. The concept does therefore need nothing else than our earlier, ordinal utility functions which levels have no meaning (except that they imply a ranking, see <a href="#sec-ordinal" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;2.6</a>).</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pareto</span> efficiency has been introduced in the context of an exchange environment, where a given endowment is possibly traded. But we needed no production. If we do allow for production, we can move on to <em>allocative efficiency</em>. Allocative efficiency means that the optimal plans for consumers and producers are aligned. The concept describes situations where not only the marginal rates of substitution are equalized across consumers but where those also coincide with the marginal rate of transformation between two goods.</p>
<p>Formally, it holds that <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mrtmrs}
\mathrm{MRT} = \mathrm{MRS}^A = \mathrm{MRS}^B.
\end{equation}\]</span> Recall from <a href="#sec-prod" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;5.1</a> that the MRT is the (absolute value of the) slope of the production possibilities frontier, PPF.</p>

<p>Let us now argue by contradiction that <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:mrtmrs}\)</span> must hold in an efficient allocation. Suppose equality <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:mrtmrs}\)</span> would not hold, but was instead <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{MRT} &gt; \mathrm{MRS}^A = \mathrm{MRS}^B\)</span>. Say that <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{MRT}=3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{MRS}^i=2\)</span>. That means, consumers are willing to give up 1 unit of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> if they get 2 more units of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> in return. Producers, however, could transform <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> into <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> at the rate 1:3 so, by reducing the production of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> by one unit, 3 more units of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> could be produced (thereby sliding <span class="math inline">\(O_B\)</span> along the PPF to the north-west). But consumers only need 2 extra units of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> to be happy. They now get one extra unit! A free lunch! Magic? By no means. It just implies that in the original situation we had not been simultaneously producing and consuming efficiently.</p>

<p>As <a href="#fig-ppfedge" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;7.2</a> illustrates, there are many situations that allow for allocative efficiencies, but they may differ across scenarios and depend on the size of the economy (production sector) and location of endowments.

<p>We can now look back at the concepts of efficiency and welfare as discussed earlier in <a href="#sec-surplus" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;6.5</a>. There, maximum welfare would be attained where the last unit sold was worth to consumers as much as it would cost firms to produce it, or where marginal benefit equals marginal cost.

<p>How do we achieve this optimal state of the world where all three types of efficiency hold simultaneously? One possibility is to introduce the notion of a social planner. This is a person or institution who asks consumers about their preferences and producers about their technology and comes up with the solution after having worked through the math. The planner will then tell producers and consumers what to do. The social planner has no other objective than to maximize welfare, and since he or she commands over full information, the implementation of his plan does result in the optimal outcome. Communism was supposed to work this way.</p>

<p>The utility possibilities frontier (UPF) shows the maximally achievable <em>level</em> of utility in a two-person economy for one agent, given the utility level of the other agent. In a single-good setting, where utilities are functions of just one argument, <span class="math inline">\(u(x)\)</span>, we can use a graph similar to <a href="#fig-ppf" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;5.2</a>. All we need to do is to relabel the diagram and use <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> instead of input and <span class="math inline">\(u()\)</span> instead of the production functions. The linear constraint in the third quadrant (south-west) of <a href="#fig-ppf" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;5.2</a> serves as the total restriction on available resources <span class="math inline">\(\bar x\)</span>, and we just need to decide how to allocate it between consumers. The resultant function in the first quadrant then is the UPF. Hence, there is an easy and intuitive way to grasp what ‘utility possibilites’ entails.</p>
<p>Returning to our two-commodity world with goods <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and the <span class="smallcaps">Edgeworth</span> box diagram <a href="#fig-Edgeworth" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;7.1</a>, adds another layer of complication. This is because there are gains from trade to be realized between consumers when exchanging <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, an aspect that is not relevant with just a single good. However, our analysis before has shown that trade in the <span class="smallcaps">Edgeworth</span> box will find a <span class="smallcaps">Pareto</span> efficient allocation on the contract curve.</p>

<p>Analogously to a production possibility frontier (PPF) of two countries or two firms, the new curve in the <span class="math inline">\(u_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(u_B\)</span> diagram defines a <em>utility possibility frontier</em> (UPF). The UPF embodies a tradeoff: since consumption utility is derived from what each person consumes, moving a unit of a consumption good from one person to another without changing the overall resources (size of the <span class="smallcaps">Edgeworth</span> box), involves that a higher utility of one person comes at the expense of the other person’s utility. We would then be moving <em>along</em> the UPF (in a similar way as we had been moving along the contract curve in the left panel of <a href="#fig-upf_edge" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;8.1</a>). On the UPF we have, as we have on the contract curve, <span class="smallcaps">Pareto</span> efficiency. Any move away from the UPF is either infeasible (to the north-east), or leaves gains from trade unexploited (to the interior).</p>

<p>We have seen that there are possibly many <span class="smallcaps">Pareto</span> efficient allocations (all points on the utility possibility frontier). If we were to apply the <span class="smallcaps">Pareto</span> criterion to evaluate possible allocations, the exercise would stop there. This is because the <span class="smallcaps">Pareto</span> criterion does not allow us to go beyond the point where no-one’s position can be improved without making the position of someone else worse.</p>
<p>Can we say more? It turns out that we can, under certain additional assumptions. We may want to incorporate fairness or equity since we may think that some allocations are more fair (more equitable) than others. The two points where the UPF cuts the axes in the Figure below for instance, are allocations that are <span class="smallcaps">Pareto</span> efficient. They allocate all resources in the economy to one person A or B, without leaving any utility to the other person, however. Many believe this not to be fair.</p>
<p>Issues of equity require ethical judgments. They also require that we can make <em>interpersonal comparisons of utility levels</em>, something that we did not need until now. This is because we may want to compare two <span class="smallcaps">Pareto</span> efficient allocations and judge which is ‘better’. If we are to go along the UPF, we certainly make one person worse off and the other one better off. We then leave the straightjacket concept of the <span class="smallcaps">Pareto</span> criterion, since such a move could not happen under voluntary trade. In order to operationalize such comparisons, we first need to be able to measure utility of individuals in comparable units, and if there is a difference in utility levels we need to be able to tell how big that difference is.</p>
<p>There has been a long debate in the history of economic thought as to whether this is actually possible. The standard approach only requires us to say something about the ranking or ordering of indifference curves, but the utility labels attached to indifference curves have had no meaning. In order to make efficient choices, it was not necessary to say: an apple is worth 3 ‘utils’ to Paul and 5 ‘utils’ to Clara, so we should take a slice of the apple away from Clara and give it to Paul in order for each person to have the same level of utility of 4 ‘utils’.</p>
<p>What is more, we need to express how society relates individual utilities to each other. A rule that tells how ‘social welfare’ derives from ‘individual welfares’ (or utilities), is called a <em>social welfare function</em> (SWF). It is an eminently important concept in public economics, in the part of economics that explicitly deals with the collective choices of society.</p>

<h2 data-number="8.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-swf"><span class="header-section-number">8.3</span> Social Welfare Function and the First-Best</h2>
<p>In an approach advocated by <span class="smallcaps">Bergson</span> and <span class="smallcaps">Samuelson</span>,social welfare as the welfare of society at large is a function of individual utilities, and nothing else. The SWF may be written as follows: <span class="math display">\[\mbox{social welfare} = W(u^A,u^B).\]</span> This is a rather generic way of writing things down. We can now do the thought experiment and increase utility of person A, say, while keeping utility of B constant. We can do this by giving that person a bit of a commodity that he likes. Say, an apple. This variation (<span class="math inline">\(u^A\)</span> goes up) may increase social welfare, that is, society may be better off since one person gets better off (<span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> goes up as well). But <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> may also rise if the apple that we give to person A is taken away from person B. That is, even though this is not a <span class="smallcaps">Pareto</span> improvement, society may be better off from just redistributing resources differently between people; and yes, there may be losers.</p>
<p>It is one thing to say that social welfare should be based on individual utilities. But there are many different ways in which the function <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> combines these individual utilities. As the example just mentioned shows, the SWF criterion can involve considerations <em>beyond</em> individual values and express what society thinks about equity. Putting it this way highlights that society is more than just a collection of individuals. Society has preferences of its own, has, as it were, a ‘utility function’ of its own.</p>
<p>It may help to illustrate the SWF concept with particular functional forms. Three popular expressions for a SWF are <span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:SWFU}
\mathrm{utilitarian:}\;\; W(u^A,u^B) &amp;=&amp;  u^A  + u^B\\
\label{eq:SWFC}
\mathrm{convex:}\;\;      W(u^A,u^B) &amp;=&amp; u^A \times u^B\\
\label{eq:SWFR}
\mathrm{Rawls:}\;\;       W(u^A,u^B) &amp;=&amp; \min\{ u^A,u^B \}
\end{eqnarray}\]</span> Let us assume that all utilities are strictly positive, <span class="math inline">\(u^A &gt; 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(u^B &gt; 0\)</span>, a necessary condition for <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:SWFC}\)</span> to make sense.</p>
<p>Characterizing social welfare functions as utility functions of society we can now move on to depict them in a diagram using social indifference curves. This is done in <a href="#fig-swf" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;8.2</a>. The arguments of <span class="math inline">\(W(\cdot)\)</span> are <span class="math inline">\(u^A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(u^B\)</span>, and thus we depict the social indifference curves in a graph with individual utilities on the axes.</p>

<p><a href="#fig-swf" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;8.2</a> allows you to switch between the various cases <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:SWFU}\)</span>-<span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:SWFR}\)</span> to depict social indifference curves (level curves of the social welfare function). Notice how the various shapes are reminiscent of consumer indifference curves and straddle extreme cases.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The first social welfare function <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:SWFU}\)</span> is the easiest one: welfare of society is just the sum of individual utilities. It was proposed by a school of English economists that called themselves utilitarians, hence the name. The utilitarian function is often associated with the name of Jeremy <span class="smallcaps">Bentham</span>, founding father of the utilitarian philosophy. Suppose social welfare were fixed at some initial level <span class="math inline">\(\overline{W}\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(\overline{W} = u^A + u^B\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(u^A=\overline{W}-u^B\)</span>. In a graph with utilities <span class="math inline">\(u^A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(u^B\)</span> on the axes, the social indifference curve map is therefore a set of declining straight lines.</p>
<p>Suppose the individual utility levels were 2 and 2, then social welfare would be 4. Similar for 1 and 3 or 0.0001 and 3.9999. The utilitarian concept only cares about the sum, and not about the distribution of utilities between individual members of society. Accordingly, it is okay when society has both people with high and people with low levels of utility. Taking the apple from B and giving it to A does not change the level of <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> (even though it changes both <span class="math inline">\(u^A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(u^B\)</span>).</p>

<p>The second function <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:SWFC}\)</span> is similar in spirit, yet different in functional form. The consequence is that very unequal distributions of utilities lead to lower levels of social welfare. Imagine again that individual utility levels were 2 and 2, then social welfare would be 4. But if individual utility levels were 0.0001 and 3.9999, social welfare would be 0.0004. That is the reason why the social indifference curve is convex to the origin. The economic interpretation is that unequal distributions are not appreciated as much by society as relatively equal distributions. Taking the apple from B and giving it to A will increase the level of <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> (despite <span class="math inline">\(u^B\)</span> decreasing). This convex function is sometimes associated with the name of John <span class="smallcaps">Nash</span>.</p>
<p>The last social welfare function <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:SWFR}\)</span> is associated with American philosopher John <span class="smallcaps">Rawls</span>. He posed the question: how would you evaluate the welfare of society before you knew which particular level of <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> you would end up with in life? That is, social welfare should be evaluated from behind a ‘veil of ignorance’, before actual levels of individual welfare are revealed. <span class="smallcaps">Rawls</span> continued to argue that the only just measure of social welfare is the utility of the person who is the worst off. That is the reason why social welfare is equal to the minimum of individual utilities, and why social indifference curves have a kink. The kinks are located on a ray of 45<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span> through the origin. Continuing the numerical example from above, social welfare according to <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:SWFR}\)</span> has value 2 if individual utilities are 2 and 2, but has value 0.0001 if individual utilities are 0.0001 and 3.9999. Social progress, defined by increasing <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>, can only be made by improving the situation of the worst-off members of society. Giving the apple to A helps to increase <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> only if there is no-one else below him in the ranking.</p>

<p>The reader may have noticed that the three special cases <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:SWFU}\)</span>-<span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:SWFR}\)</span> also correspond to CES indifference curve maps (with limit cases of perfect substitutes and perfect complements, see <a href="#fig-icces" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2.8</a>). In fact, we can go further and define, following work by Anthony <span class="smallcaps">Atkinson</span>, a class of social welfare functions that includes the foregoing as special cases. The SWF is then defined as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[W_{Atkinson}(u^A,u^B) = \frac{1}{1-\varepsilon}\left((u^A)^{1-\varepsilon}+(u^B)^{1-\varepsilon}\right).\]</span></p>

Further, when utility of income itself is linear, as in <span class="math display">\[u^A(y^A) =y^A,\]</span> say, then <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span> is indicative of society’s aversion to income inequality.

<p>Summarizing, the social welfare function tells us about the preferences that the social planner (or relevant decision makers such as politicians or political parties) has with respect to the distribution of individual welfares. What, then, does the planner choose? The answer suggests itself from <a href="#fig-swf" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;8.2</a>: the social planner chooses a point on the utility possibility frontier (UPF) that yields the highest possible social welfare level. This is achieved where a social indifference curve just touches the UPF at point F. With the three considered examples of SWFs, we make three different socially optimal choices. The procedure is fully analogous to consumers choosing an optimal consumption basket subject to a budget constraint. The social welfare maximizing point F is sometimes called the <span class="smallcaps">Pareto</span> optimum or the first-best allocation: the best of all <span class="smallcaps">Pareto</span> efficient allocations.</p>

Remark&nbsp;8.3: Preference Aggregation
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>An important question is, how is it possible to aggregate individual preferences into social preferences? The area of social choice theory deals with that question. The way we aggregate preferences in practice in order to make a social choice is determined through democratic elections and the political process.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>One important implication of the exercise in <a href="#fig-swf" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;8.2</a> is: If society is interested in achieving efficiency and has particular preferences about (in)equality or equity, first-best means there is no implicit price to be paid in terms of efficiency loss associated with pursuing equity goals. In other words, you can have both your cake and eat it. The next chapter will tell us that, under stringent assumptions, the first-best can be achieved using decentralized decision making through market interaction.</p>

<p>There is an alternative to coordination via a central social planner. This is decentral coordination via the price system, which characterizes a market economy. It is decentralized since our two persons <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> would be unlikely to haggle about giving up one liter of milk for 0.71 kg of potatoes, if that was their implied optimal rate of substitution. In reality, the two would not even meet. All they need to do is to go to the grocery store and buy these products at a given price. Note that if there are only two goods available, there is only one price that really matters: the relative price between milk and potatoes.</p>
<p>Note in addition that we have implicitly introduced a further assumption, namely that none of the market actors (consumers or producers) has any direct influence on the price (price taker behavior). This is a setting of perfectly competitive markets. We shall also assume that changes in prices will come about instantaneously and costlessly.</p>

<p>To illustrate what prices do, consider the <span class="smallcaps">Edgeworth</span> box again, now redrawn in <a href="#fig-prices" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;9.1</a>. We have drawn a ‘budget line’ through the point of initial endowment <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, and its (absolute) slope is the relative price between the goods <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\displaystyle \frac{p_x^\circ}{p_y^\circ}\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(p_x^\circ\)</span> denotes a particular value of <span class="math inline">\(p_x\)</span>). What persons <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> both do in a market economy is to choose a level of utility where their own marginal rate of substitution equals the relative price, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{MRS}^i=\frac{p_x^\circ}{p_y^\circ},\qquad i=A,B.\)</span></p>
<p>That means that automatically all marginal rates of substitutions are equalized across consumers, because the relative price applies to everybody. In <a href="#fig-prices" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;9.1</a>, however, we see that consumer <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> consumes at the blue dot and person <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> at the red dot. The total amount of good <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> that these two guys demand falls short of the amount available <span class="math inline">\(x_A+x_B\lt\bar{x}\)</span>, whereas the total amount of good <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> that both want to consume exceeds what is available, <span class="math inline">\(y_A+y_B\gt\bar{y}\)</span>. This cannot be an equilibrium. What happens in such situations in the market? Simple: the relative price will decrease to <span class="math inline">\(p_x^\star/p_y^\star\)</span>, so as to make <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> relatively more expensive and <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> relatively cheaper. Then, more of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> will be demanded and less of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, until all quantities demanded are equal to the quantities available, and all markets clear.</p>

<p>What we have looked at here is rather simple, but it does contain the core of what is important. In fact, a similar kind of argument also applies to the markets for production factors, and the same type of analysis goes through when consumption and production are simultaneously considered. Prices in equilibrium reflect overall scarcity and therefore a rising price for one good signals that scarcity for that particular good is increasing, relative to other goods. Such a price increase will affect the equilibrium quantity traded in that particular market, but also has spill-over effects on other markets. In equilibrium, all relative prices are such that there is no difference anymore between the quantities demanded and supplied on any market. The ‘invisible hand’ achieves decentralized coordination of individual production and consumption decisions via the price system such that <span class="smallcaps">Paretian</span> welfare is maximized.</p>

<h2 data-number="9.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-firstth"><span class="header-section-number">9.2</span> The First Fundamental Theorem of Welfare Economics</h2>
<p>To sum up, what it takes to achieve maximal welfare in the <span class="smallcaps">Pareto</span> sense is a complete set of perfectly competitive markets. To recap, the underlying assumptions are: goods are homogeneous, there is complete and symmetric information for everybody about all prices, quantities, and other parties’ strategies, there are no transactions costs and prices adjust instantaneously, and none of the market actors (consumers or producers) has any direct influence on the price (price taker behavior). We then will have that what it takes producers to transform one unit of a good into some other good (the marginal rate of transformation, or the slope of the PPF), equals the relative price of that good in terms of the other good (the rate at which goods can be sold and bought on the market). In turn, also for every consumer we have that what they are willing to give up of one good in order to obtain one extra unit of some other good (the marginal rate of substitution) equals the relative price. This is the condition for allocative efficiency <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:mrtmrs}\)</span> which is, under the abovementioned assumptions, achieved automatically in market equilibrium: <span class="math display">\[\mathrm{MRT} = \frac{p_x}{p_y} = \mathrm{MRS}^A = \mathrm{MRS}^B.\]</span></p>
<p>Without further proof we state the following:</p>

</div>
<p>Hence, market competition implies efficiency. The intuition is that under the conditions of competition, every rational actor (consumer or firm) does the best they can to act in their own best interest, given the (relative) prices, and given those prices, they must adjust accordingly until their marginal rates are equal to the relative prices.

<p>The second theorem tells us that if the government prefers one point on the UPF, call it <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, while consumers have chosen point <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, all the government needs to do is to change the initial endowments of resources appropriately, and the market mechanism will do the rest.

<p>For the second theorem to hold, in addition to the conditions mentioned above, we need the technical assumptions that both consumer preferences and production technologies are convex (giving rise to UPFs and PPFs of the concave shapes). Note that the implementation of the change in initial endowments is a tricky business: technically, we need <em>lump-sum</em> transfers (taxes or subsidies). Lump-sum transfers involve that we can shift resources from person A to B (or reverse) without altering the agents’ behavior in response to this initial redistribution.</p>

<h2 data-number="9.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-secbest"><span class="header-section-number">9.4</span> Second Best</h2>
<p>The ideal world of a competitive market equilibrium where welfare is maximized is sometimes dubbed <em>first best</em>. Economic policy can in many instances only achieve <em>second best</em> outcomes. What does that mean? Suppose that in one market the optimality conditions are not fulfilled but distorted, perhaps because there is asymmetric information, or because there is market power, an externality, or some other form of market failure or a tax. Also assume that the government cannot do anything to remove the problem directly. The second-best view now maintains that one should also let go of pursuing first-best allocations in all other markets: what used to be optimal without any distortions is not optimal anymore when some distortion occurs in one of the other markets. This is because in a general economic system all markets are linked with each other through relative prices. Once there is a price distortion in one market, relative prices with other markets will be affected as well, and they lose some of their ability to signal scarcity and redirect resources to their best uses.</p>
<!-- Two Column Setup _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ -->
<div class="grid">
<div class="g-col-6">
<p>The second best view implies that if we try to maximize total welfare in the face of distortions, we need to be aware of the fact that the conditions for optimality have changed. As a consequence, policy makers will not be able anymore to choose an allocation that is both efficient and equitable. There will be instead a fundamental trade-off that society has to make: typically higher equity must be ‘bought’ by foregoing efficiency.</p>
<p>This can be illustrated with <a href="#fig-secbest" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;9.3</a>. Consider any point on the UPF. This may be a market equilibrium. A social indifference curve will go through this point on the UPF, social welfare will have a particular level, say, <span class="math inline">\(W_\mathtt{I}\)</span>. The social optimum will have welfare level, say, <span class="math inline">\(W_\mathtt{III}\)</span>. Yet, while moving away from the market equilibrium by means of redistributing incomes, we lose efficiency and we may end up in a point below the (first best) efficient frontier.</p>

<p>The efficiency loss comes about because we cannot take welfare away from one person and increase that of another without changing their behavior. There are no lump-sum taxes. In reality, we are facing a loss in resources (deadweight loss). But a loss in available resources means that that the UPF locus in <a href="#fig-secbest" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;9.3</a> shifts inwards (second best UPF). The chosen point is therefore only <em>constrained efficient</em>. Here, social welfare is being maximized given that <em>after</em> redistribution the ‘pie’ has become smaller. The shrinking of the pie (inefficiency) is the price we pay if we not only care about the size of the pie, but also about how the pie is split (equity). It is for many people better that two parties get a tiny slice of a small pie than one guy getting all of a big pie. These are important considerations for policy makers.</p>

<p>It is easy to imagine why very unequal distributions of resources cause a stir in public debates. Consider the distribution of private wealth (net of liabilities) in the United States.

That leaves the other 99% of all people to own the remaining 58% of all financial wealth. But even among the 99%, the distribution is very unequal. The top 10% owns 85% of all financial wealth, the other 90% owns not so much at all (15%).</p>

Endowments would play a particular role, since they define the starting position from which trade and market interaction take place. Those equipped with limited resources may only find small possibilities to realize Pareto improving trades. The message of the Second Theorem of Welfare Economics is that a suitable redistribution of initial endowments can bring about desired outcomes in terms of equity since it equalizes the starting conditions, or the <em>opportunities</em> that people face. The model described is a simple static exercise that emphasizes efficient use of resources, but neglects dynamic processes of income generation and wealth accumulation. Those will be important when concerned with observed <em>inequalities of outcomes</em> in societies.</p>
<p>Part of what constitutes inequality in society is due to differential access to important determinants of wellbeing, in particular, housing, education, health care, healthy nutrition, a clean environment, safety and security, access to financial markets, and so on, but also racial, ethnic, gender-based, social or political discrimination that lead to entrenched differences between groups in society (<em>horizontal inequality</em>). Another part is differential equipment with innate abilities or talents. In a fictitious society in which initially equal persons start off into life and where there are no differences in terms of talents, differential opportunities to build skills, or protect livelihoods can lead over time to drastic differences in outcomes such as income or wealth. Conversely, inequality of outcomes can manifest itself over time in a society with equal opportunities but differential talents that are being rewarded differently in the market. In addition, obviously, rewards to personal effort will be an important part of determining one’s position in society, and in some sense evolve naturally in a market environment.</p>
<p>Inequality of opportunity is in some sense structural inequality that can be influenced by government policy to strengthen institutions. Provide affordable housing to the poor, provide access to basic (and possibly further) eduction to everyone, make sure that access to reliable health care is not driven by income positions of households, provide public goods and infrastructure that offer possibilities for development and protection, etc. The degree to which government policy should achieve an equalization of opportunities remains a political choice, however.</p>
<p>Achieving a reduction of inequality of outcomes and <em>vertical inequality</em> (between the rich and the poor) is even more a political choice, and there is little guidance that economists can give. The theory of the Second Best warns that actual redistribution through a tax and transfer system may result in a loss of economic efficiency and waste of resources, which is the price a society needs to pay to ‘correct’ market outcomes. There are many aspects to how these inefficiencies can materialize, some of them may have to do with destroying incentives for effort provision when individuals know that their incomes will be taxed or that benefits will be paid even without working.</p>
<p>There is no clean separation between inequality of opportunity and of outcomes, however. After all, opportunities of a generation shapes their outomes, but outcomes of parents also determine the opportunities for their children.</p>
<p>It is to inequality of outcomes that we now turn, and in particular to issues of measurement.</p>

<h2 data-number="10.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-inccons"><span class="header-section-number">10.2</span> Inequality of What? Income, Wealth or Consumption?</h2>
<p>Measuring inequality and poverty is about describing and quantifying aspects of the distribution of a variable of interest. This could typically be income, but it might be wealth or consumption.</p>
<p>Welfare based on consumption is the mainstay of economic welfare measurement, see <a href="#sec-welfare" class="quarto-xref">Chapter&nbsp;4</a>. Indeed, utility has been defined as a function of quantities consumed, making it natural to base poverty analysis on consumption measures. In order to do this, one typically needs to have access to detailed consumption or expenditure survey data that sample the population of interest.</p>
<p>Income data are sometimes available from government tax records, and become increasingly available for research purposes. The income tax is one of the most comprehensive taxes that have been introduced on a global scale and in principle, income data of high quality may be available. Since raising income taxes implies the periodic and routine collection of large income data sets, the cost of gathering and assembling the data for statistical research purposes become relatively small.</p>
<p>One may want to measure income on a per capita basis, but since typical households are composed of one or two income earners and perhaps several non-earning dependent household members of various sex and age compostion (children, older people), incomes will be shared within the household. That means that earners will be poorer and non-earners may be less poor than their individual incomes may suggest. Empirical research has taken to measure incomes at the household level, and tries to account for heterogeneity in household composition using so-called equivalence scales that help expressing cost of living of a household relative to those of a reference household (such as prime aged single adults).</p>
<p>Income is not the only measure of resources that households command over, many households also have accumulated wealth or assets. Taking those into account poses again difficulties. To begin with, unlike an income tax, wealth taxes are not levied in many countries, or only above large exemption thresholds, or only for selected asset and liability types. Wealth information in survey data, conversely, may not be accurately measured because of selective response (or non-response), and because a market value is not always easy to determine.</p>
<p>Since consumption surveys are costly to field, consumption data may not be very readily available. However, using consumption data also has a couple of advantages relative to using income data, since</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>incomes may be incompletely measurable in economies with large agricultural and self-employed shares</li>
<li>incomes may fluctuate over time, consumption tends to be less volatile.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first point is particularly salient in developing countries where small-holder farming is prevalent. Those farm households are often subsistence farmers that are producer-consumers. This entails that much of what they consume they have produced themselves, so that their market income may be a very inaccurate measure of their actual consumption possibilities. A similar remark can be made about the self-employed, who also represent a larger share of the population in selected Western countries. In addition, self-employment may be correlated with tax evasion, so that the income that a self-employed person reports to the tax authority does not fully reflect the actual earnings or disposable income.</p>
<p>The second point is a consequence of chosen consumption behavior over time. In a world without frictions on financial markets, consumers can shift resources (income) over time, such that they determine a consumption path that is independent of the time path of income. In particular, individuals with convex indifference curves typically prefer consumption tomorrow to be similar to consumption today, and if they can (or, unless they are borrowing constrained), they use saving or borrowing to smooth the time path of consumption.</p>
<p>Conversely, having detailed consumption data available may also reveal too much useful information, and for practical purposes, one may want to aggregate goods into broader expenditure categories. For instance, one may add up consumptions of particular commodities or services into aggregate (price-weighted) consumption categories: <span class="math display">\[\overbrace{p_1x_1+p_2x_2+\ldots}^{\text{food}} + \overbrace{p_7x_7+p_8x_8+\ldots}^{\text{clothing}} + \ldots\]</span> where, e.g., food contains “cereals, fruit, vegetable, meat”, and clothing may contain “leisure clothes, work clothes, shoes, outerwear, underwear”. Within a broad expenditure category, individuals may be able and willing to substitute when facing relative prices changes, but there may be less substitutability between food and clothing at large.</p>
<p>Focusing on food to quantify poverty may sound plausible at first sight, as empirically the budget share of food declines with income (see “<span class="smallcaps">Engel</span>’s Law”, <a href="#sec-engel" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;4.2</a>). The implication is that the poor devote a much larger share of income to food than the non-poor. Yet, income elasticities vary by a wide margin between individuals and households, such that it becomes ambiguous where to draw the line between the poor and the non-poor. In Western societies access to food (and perhaps even to balanced and healthy nutrition) is but one of many needs deemed relevant by policymakers.</p>
<p>Conversely, and often encountered in development contexts, sometimes emphasis is put on using nutritional indicators (e.g.&nbsp;calorie or vitamin intake) as food consumption proxy. This has a clear appeal in the context of poverty measurement, since food consumption is particularly precarious among the poorest poor and will be having priority among the needs that the very poor need to address first, especially in cases of imminent malnutrition.</p>
<p>Yet, economic welfare will be incompletely captured by simple nutrition indicators to begin with. One issue is that nutritional requirements may vary in the population and one may need to condition on anthropometric information (e.g.&nbsp;body weight and height). This, however, will in many cases also not deliver sufficiently reliable measures of food poverty, since a number of other aspects contributing to the quality of food intake are unaccounted for. This is perhaps underscored by the forceful global increase in obesity that has not left poor communities unaffected.</p>

<h2 data-number="10.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-distrib"><span class="header-section-number">10.3</span> Statistical Distributions</h2>
<p>Denote the variable of interest, be it income, wealth, or consumption, by <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. This is a one-dimensional variate and can be measured on a continuous scale. In a (large) population, different individuals (or households) have different realizations of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. It is those differences we turn to.</p>
<p>We shall focus on a description of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> in statistical terms. For statistical analysis of a data set, we may have a random sample of size <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> at hand, with values <span class="math inline">\(y_i, i=1,\ldots, N\)</span>. The main idea is to take the sample values and study the aspects of the distribution that somehow are informative about whether and how many people can be classified as poor, or how different various people are from one another.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is continuously distributed, and hence could take any real value, then its distribution can be represented by a probability density function (pdf) <span class="math inline">\(f_Y(y)\)</span>, or a cumulative distribution function (cdf), which is the integral under the pdf, <span class="math inline">\(F_Y(y)=\int_{\min\{y\}}^y f(z) \text{d}z\)</span>.</p>
<p>An example of a continuous distribution is the normal distribution, whose pdf and cdf are illustrated in <a href="#fig-normal" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;10.1</a>. A first glimpse of what inequality may entail can be had by changing the spread of the distribution, here captured by the standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>.</p>

<p>The axis label of our diagram is in the horizontal direction the cumulative fraction of the population. This is a number that runs from zero to 1, or from zero to 100%. On the vertical axis, we put the cumulative fraction of income, again taking values between zero and one. Along the 45<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span> line we would have complete equality of incomes: the lowest 20% of all income earners in the population own together 20% of all income. The lowest 60% of all income earners, or the poorest 60% of all income earners, earn together, 60% of total income, and so on. For any given value of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, we can determine the particular value of the <span class="smallcaps">Lorenz</span> curve.</p>

<p>The <span class="smallcaps">Gini</span> will change once we change the composition of the population, or once we change the incomes that the different groups command over. Suppose we make the poorer somewhat poorer and the richer somewhat richer, then we would move the distribution in a vertical way down. Shift point <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> in <a href="#fig-2groupLC" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;10.3</a> to see this. Perhaps to a point where we have around 75% of the population commanding over 20% of total income. That would give us a <span class="smallcaps">Gini</span> coefficient of 0.5.

<p>There are two extremes for the <span class="smallcaps">Gini</span>. The lower bound is 0, indicating that there is no inequality in the population.

<p>There are many different statistical summary measures of inequality. In order to limit attention to those that are sensitive to redistribution, consider applying the:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><span class="smallcaps">Pigou-Dalton</span> Principle:<br> Under a transfer from a rich to a poor individual that preserves both ranking of individuals and total income, inequality must decrease.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The transfer considered under this principle is one where we make the rich a little less rich by <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> dollars and the poor a little less poor by <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> dollars, without flipping their relative positions (i.e., without the transfer making a rich person poor and a poor person rich). Since <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is constant and nothing is lost, the transfer weighs more relative to the before-transfer income of the poor than of the rich (e.g., the <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> dollars might represent 1% of a rich person’s income but 10% of a poor person’s income.)</p>
<p>We still have a large number of inequality measures that we could use in order to characterize inequality.</p>

<p>The first is the so-called coefficient of variation, a simple statistical measure that relates the standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> to the mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> of the distribution, perhaps scaled by <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{N-1}\)</span>. This is a measure that is strictly non-negative (zero or positive). A higher variation, as reflected by a higher standard deviation, will increase the CV, implying it is not bounded from above. The CV is unit free, since we divide <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> which are both measured in the same units.

<p>What effect does redistribution through the tax and transfer system have on the inequality measurements? Taking from the rich to give to the poor, makes the rich a little less rich and the poor a little less poor. This can be considered if the social welfare function suggests that inequality is of policy concern. Of course, such redistribution does not tackle the causes of inequality, rather its symptoms.</p>

<p>One way of achieving such a redistribution is through a budget-neutral tax and transfer system, that taxes incomes proportionally and returns the collected money as a lump sum payment to every citizen. Consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>a distribution of incomes <span class="math inline">\(\{y_1,\ldots,y_N\}\)</span></li>
<li>a proportional income tax at a uniform rate <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span></li>
<li>implying total tax revenue over all citizens of <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{i=1}^N \tau y_i\)</span></li>
<li>which can be paid out to each citizen as a lump sum payment (same amount to everybody)</li>
<li>the income after taxes and transfers becomes <span class="math display">\[
\text{after-tax income } \tilde{y}_i = y_i(1-\tau)+\tau \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N y_i
\]</span></li>
<li>where we have assumed that mean income does not change with redistribution (that is, there is no discouragement to earn income)</li>
</ul>
<p>What does such a redistribution system do to the shape and location of the <span class="smallcaps">Lorenz</span> curve? It shifts <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda'\)</span>, towards the line of equality, thereby reducing the <span class="smallcaps">Gini</span>. At the same time, social welfare, when measured through a concave SWF, will increase, as shown by <span class="smallcaps">Atkinson</span></p>

<p>Poverty, specifically, refers to an individual’s or household’s lack of command over commodities, or lack of specific consumption goods in terms of quantity or quality. In a wider sense, poverty refers to a lack of ‘welfare’.</p>
<p>Much of poverty measurement, conversely, focuses on using statistical information in order to gauge the extent of poverty. Measurements are a suitable way to quantify the extent of poverty, and various policies can be used to try to reduce poverty, at the macro and at the micro level. Those include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Growth strategy
<ul>
<li>Has poverty increased? Did growth help the poor? How did relative price changes affect the poor? What is the impact of food price fluctuations? Who were the losers and who were the gainersfrom economy-wide policy reforms?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Social Spending
<ul>
<li>Who uses public services? At what cost? Who benefits from government subsidies? On average, versus at the margin? Who will be hurt by retrenchment?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Targeted Interventions
<ul>
<li>Who are the target groups? How should transfers be allocated? How much impact will they have on poverty?</li>

<p>By profiling one commonly understands a characterization of a certain group, event, or state of affairs in terms of typical features, using empirical data. A poverty profile tries to determine which groups in the population are more likely to be considered poor, or how a statistical poverty measure correlates with measurable characteristics in the data. The reason for doing so is to identify individuals and households at the risk of poverty, and giving policy makers a first handle on whom to target using anti-poverty programs or anti-poverty policies. In Western countries, the incidence of poverty is typically higher among the lower-educated, especially those with deficiencies in literacy, financial literacy, and numeracy, among single parents, families with many children, and individuals with origins in non-Western countries. Poverty can also be profiled in terms of outcomes, that is, living conditions, as the poor are more likely to live in lower-quality housing. In developing countries, housing attributes (from leaky roofs, to lack of electricity, sanitary facilities or water supply) can be effective if incomplete markers of poverty.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis can help uncovering salient patterns in the data. It is important, however, not to use a single measure of poverty and not to use a narrowly defined proxy for welfare (e.g., only food consumption, or only asset ownership). We review a few often-used measures.</p>

<h3 data-number="10.8.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-poverty-line"><span class="header-section-number">10.8.2</span> The Poverty Line</h3>
<p>Poverty in terms of the one-dimensional variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> (income, consumption) is often understood as a binary classification: individuals or households are either poor or not. The division line to separate the poor from the non-poor is the so-called <em>poverty line</em> or <em>poverty threshold</em>, denoted <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>. In other words, <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is that level of income or consumption below which individuals or households are deemed poor. One can thus conceive of <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> as a consumption floor or desired minimal living standard that policy makers wish to guarantee.</p>
<p>In terms of the distribution, the poverty line directs the focus on the lower part of the distribution. This is illustrated in <a href="#fig-fgt" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;10.5</a>. Readers can use the slider to determine how large the incidence of poverty is in terms of the area under the pdf to the left of <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> while changing <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>. The location of <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is ultimately a policy choice. It can be fixed in absolute, but also in relative terms.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is somehow agreed upon, policy then tries to move people from below <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> (or just above), using various measures, such as minimum wage legislation, social welfare benefits, or the provision of physical consumption goods including social housing, food stamps, perhaps basic education and on-the-job training, or access to certain forms of health care. Real-world policy approaches to poverty can be quite complex, however, since the reasons for why individuals or households are poor first need to be well understood, and poverty is not just a one-dimensional phenomenon. On top of that, the success of any poverty policy depends on how individuals and households react to it.</p>
If <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is defined in absolute terms, we can think of it as referring to minimum income or a consumption floor (often at subsistence level). This can be operationalized by defining
<ul>
<li>
desirable levels of food-energy intake (nutritional valuation, e.g., calorie-based)
</li>
<li>
or a $ value, as a minimum necessary expenditure level to afford a basic needs consumption basket (which can be price-weighted; in addition to food, covering clothing, heating, and housing may be considered).
</li>
</ul>
If <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is defined in relative terms, it may be used to reflect ‘deprivation’ and socio-cultural norms. This can be operationalized by defining
<ul>
<li>
a percentile of the income/consumption distribution (e.g., the 10% poorest)
</li>
<li>
a fraction of median income (say, 60% of median)
</li>
<li>
or a subjective poverty line (quesitionnaire-based subjective assessment of minimum necessary income to ‘make ends meet’).
</li>
</ul>

<p>Once we have defined a value for <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>, we can try to measure the extent of poverty using statistical techniques and microeconomic data on income or consumption.</p>
<p>Canonical statistical measures of poverty (Poverty Indices, PI) include the following</p>
<ul>
<li><em>headcount ratio</em> (HC): what percentage of population has income below poverty line?</li>
<li><em>poverty gap</em> (PG): what is the average relative distance of the poor from the poverty line?</li>
<li><em>squared PG</em> (SPG): what is the average relative squared distance of the poor from the poverty line?</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#fig-fgt" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;10.5</a> illustrates these three measures, based on the pdf of a lognormal income distribution. The three measures are printed in the graph. They implicitly weigh observations to the left of the poverty line differently. HC uses a uniform weight, PG uses a linear falling weight (observations near the poverty line have a small weight, observations far from the poverty line have a large weight), and the SPG uses quadratic weights (observations far from the poverty line get much more weight than those close to the line).</p>

<p>One influential approach to conceptualize poverty, advocated by Nobel prize laureate Amartya <span class="smallcaps">Sen</span>, focuses on individuals’ our households’ actual functionings, and capabilities and opportunities to lead a fulfilled life. This includes not only material well-being but also the consideration that different people may be able to achieve certain functionings to a very different degree, even if they command over the same financial resources. For instance, someone with a physical impairment may have very different needs to move from A to B than a bodily able person. What matters is the outcome, not the (financial) input. Poverty then is the limitation or inability to achieve the outcome.</p>
<p>The traditional statistical poverty measures based on univariate indicators such as income or consumption are not fully suited to capture the limitations and deprivations that people experience. They may fail to detect poverty or overemphasize it, since they do not have a deeper foundation. Hence, a more comprehensive approach is called for, taking into account the social context, housing, access to health care and education.</p>
Amartya <span class="smallcaps">Sen</span> instead advocated a so-called axiomatic approach starting from a number of desirable properties that a poverty measure should possess
<ul>
<li>
[A] <em>anonymity:</em> the identity of the household does not matter
</li>
<li>
[T] <em>weak transfer axiom:</em> poverty decreases with redistribution among the poor
</li>
<li>
[M] <em>monotonicity:</em> poverty declines with rising income of the poor
</li>
<li>
[F] <em>focus axiom:</em> redistribution among the non-poor does not change poverty

<p>Poverty relief measures typically come in the form of a cash or in-kind transfer to targeted and identified individuals. Cash transfers can be used to move individuals back to the poverty line in terms of disposable income, for instance during inflationary periods, or to counteract a price hike on specific goods (say household gas and electricity). The latter can avail itself of the idea of compensating variation (see <a href="#sec-compensating" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;4.6</a>).</p>

<p>We consider in-kind benefits in <a href="#fig-inkind" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;10.6</a>. There are two goods, food <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>, and other goods, denoted <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span>. The initial budget constraint is blue. Absent other restrictions, the individual will choose point <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span> on the blue indifference curve.</p>
<p>The government gives out food stamps to this individual. That is, the individual’s choice set is enlarged in the food (or <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>) dimension, but not in the other direction. With food stamps, recipients are only allowed to buy food, but no clothes, mobile phones, or alcohol. These stamps can be redeemed at selected vendors only, and we assume there is no second hand market where these stamps could be traded for money and then be used to buy other goods than food. The result of the food stamp program is that the budget set shifts to the right, from the blue to the red. The upper portion to the north-west of <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span> is not available. Instead, the budget set features a kink at <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span>. With the given indifference curves, the individual will therefore optimally choose point <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span> when food stamps are available: this yields the highest level of utility attainable (red indifference curve) under the new budget set.

<p>Now consider the case of a money transfer equivalent to the value of the food stamps: the individual can now buy other things it pleases, such as cigarettes or alcohol. It always is possible to convert all that money into food, hence the consumption possibilities are no less than in the food–stamps–only situation. But now, the line segment to the northwest of <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span> is part of the budget set. The individual chooses <span class="math inline">\(E_3\)</span> (it is coincidence that it is just vertically above <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span>). Compared to <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span>, the individual now buys less food and more of the other good. But it also achieves a higher level of utility than in the second situation, since the grey indifference curve is clearly the highest one. Hence, giving food stamps to people is not necessarily the best idea: their choice set is restricted and their welfare might be lower than otherwise possible <em>with the same amount of benefit transfers</em> for the state.</p>
<p>If the indifference curves of our individual were slightly different it might instead choose a point on the downward falling segment of the red constraint. In that case, it does not matter how it is achieved: with food stamps or with money. This illustrates that in–kind benefits are not necessarily worse than money transfers, although they might be.</p>
<p>The reason why some governments choose to give out food stamps rather than money may have to do with paternalism, or with taxpayer’s sentiments. If welfare recipients get money and buy beer for themselves instead of milk for their children, the government may find that the individual is not acting in its own (and its dependents’) best interest. Similarly, if welfare recipients are able to buy alcohol, taxpayers (that are also voters), might see the benefit transfer as a ‘waste on the wrong ends’. Either way, basing welfare on in–kind benefits seems to indicate that the ones who ultimately pay the bill do not agree with or do not trust the free choice of the recipients.</p>

<p>The compensating variation (<a href="#sec-compensating" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;4.6</a>) tries to <em>restore</em> the utility or welfare level of individuals, for instance after having dropped from the poverty line to below the poverty line due to a price hike of particular goods. Governments sometimes try to limit or manipulate the price of those goods directly by way of subsidies, but doing so has the disadvantage that prices lose their flexibility and hence their function to effectively signal scarcity. Often, this results in larger inefficiencies. In addition, price manipulations are not per se targeted and may benefit the non-poor more than the poor.</p>
<p>Whereas cash transfers are an appropriate way to counteract an income drop caused by a price hike in terms of utility, the question is how much to compensate. After all, other individuals in the economy may have to pay more taxes when the government raises cash transfers. The following panel illustrates with an example of a needy citizen and a thrifty government. The compensating variation would be the least-cost option from the government’s point of view.</p>

<h2 data-number="10.10" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-povLS"><span class="header-section-number">10.10</span> Anti-Poverty Policy and Labor Supply</h2>
<p>Anti-poverty policy is geared at guaranteeing a consumption floor, or a minimal standard of living to every citizen. However, policy is typically painfully aware of the negative incentive effects of transferring money to citizens. Instead, they need to be encouraged to earn their own income and be self-reliant. Depending on the circumstances of the individual (or on general labor market conditions), earnings may not be enough to stay out of poverty (the working poor), or they may not be generated in the first place because welfare recipients find it unattractive to work.</p>
<p>We look at the following policy tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>minimum wage (floor on hourly wages, irrespective of skill level or experience)</li>
<li>unconditional basic income (lump-sum payment to all, no strings attached)</li>
<li>means-tested benefits (benefits exceeding own earnings up to the poverty line)</li>
<li>earned-income tax credit (targeted wage subsidy, turning stepwise into tax)</li>
</ul>
<p>All of them can be analyzed in the simple labor supply framework of <a href="#sec-labor" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;3.6</a> that plots indifference curves and budget constraints in a diagram with consumption and leisure (non-work) on the axes. Analytically, the material in <a href="#sec-piecewise" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;3.5</a> (nonlinear budget constraints and nonconvexities in budget sets) is worth reviewing.</p>

<h3 data-number="10.10.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="minimum-wage"><span class="header-section-number">10.10.1</span> Minimum Wage</h3>
<p>For the minimum wage we can use a diagram much like <a href="#fig-labor" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;3.6</a> and study what happens when the going wage rate (slope of the budget constraint) is being increased. As usual, there will be income and substitution effects that may go in opposite directions, but the total effect cannot be signed or quantified in general—it will depend on the shape of the indifference curves. It is possible, as <a href="#fig-labor" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;3.6</a> demonstrates, that increasing the minimum wage reduces overall labor supply. This may have an adverse effect on the poverty reduction efficacy of this policy tool.</p>

<div class="grid">
<div class="g-col-6">
<p>In its essential form, the idea of a universal basic income is an unconditional fixed benefit, paid to everyone, irrespective of need. Hence, the UBI is not targeted to the poor. There are also no further qualification requirements, and there is no limitation in terms of program duration. The motivation of introducing such a generous benefit is to allow people to take some time to find a suitable job, study, or occupation without being exposed to complying with stressful job search requirements, and so on.</p>
<p>Conversely, since the UBI will aim to provide a minimal standard of living to everyone, the layered and complex structure of multiple benefits, that are difficult to understand in their implications, and expensive to administer, can be removed. A pure UBI is, thanks to its universality and simplicity, easy to administer.</p>
<p>What the UBI does in the labor supply model is to shift the budget constraint up. Again, there may be income effects on labor supply, whose sign depends on the shape of the indifference curves, but there are no substitution effects as would be expected with a minimum wage. Compare <a href="#fig-ubi" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;10.7</a>.</p>
<p>There are only few field experiments (e.g.&nbsp;Finland) that have probed to introduce a UBI and compare labor supply outcomes to a control group that does not receive the UBI. In reality, the UBI is almost never truly universal. Existing evidence is inconclusive, but there is not too much scientifically validated support for this fiscally expansive and expensive measure.</p>

<p>The traditional way of paying welfare benefits is to reduce them dollar-for-dollar when the receiving individual earns own income. This is due to a means test. With reference to <a href="#fig-meanstest" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;10.8</a>, the benefit <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> should bring the individual to the poverty line <span class="math inline">\(y_{\min}\)</span>, but it will be cut accordingly as recipient’s own means (earnings, wealth) rise. This construction involves that there is an implicit tax rate of 100% for every marginal dollar earned.</p>
<p>Note that the budget constraint has two kinks, a convex one where hours worked equals <span class="math inline">\(b/w\)</span>, and one at the point of zero hours (or full leisure consumption equal to the total time endowment <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>). The latter is point <span class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span>.

<div class="g-col-6">
<p>The earned income tax credit resembles a mixed system, in between a minimum wage and a means-tested benefit. The budget constraint in <a href="#fig-eitc" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;10.9</a> has several segments:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>phase-in: wage subsidy increases <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span></li>
<li>flat part: wage subsidy ceased</li>
<li>phase-out: wage tax decreases <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>There are three kinks, but none at zero hours of work. The first kink on the right is possibly the most salient, and one might expect many people to choose the kink as their utility maximizing option. The second kink in the middle is less pronounced, but also here one may expect individuals that are aware of the system to choose this particular kink. This way, the EITC keeps an incentive to work, at least a small number of hours, and due to taxation in the phase-out section, it avoids the potential financing problem of the UBI.</p>
<p>In the United States, the EITC has become a mainstay of social policy and it has proven effective to pull people into the labor market. This way, individuals stay in touch with labor market developments and they can possibly maintain the skills necessary to support themselves by earning a living wage. The target group of the EITC is in particular single parents and families with children. Many other countries have, over time, introduced similar policies.</p>

<h2 data-number="11.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-property"><span class="header-section-number">11.1</span> Poorly Defined Property Rights</h2>
<p>Central to the functioning of markets is the definition of property rights. Return to <a href="#fig-Edgeworth" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;7.1</a>, in which it is obvious that there cannot be doubt about who owns and has the right to sell which units of each good (property right). If that were in dispute, exchange could not take place.</p>
<p>That seems logical. But one should not overlook that there are goods where property rights are not or not well defined, where it is not clear who owns a certain good, and who needs to get a compensation payment when selling the good. Consider the example of externalities.</p>
<p>For me, an externality is a side-effect of somebody else’s economic activity on my own economic activity (or well-being) for which there are no monetary compensations. The famous example of the bee-keeper and the orchard farmer illustrates: the production of honey depends on the number of fruit trees in the orchard, while the production of apples needs bees for pollination. These are positive externalities. The apple farmer is not going to pay the bee-keeper any money for his use of the bees, nor will he receive any compensation for the nectar.</p>
<p>Conversely, think of environmental damage done: if I pollute the air you breathe, but you do not own that air, you cannot demand compensation from me, and hence I need not take into account the consequences of my actions on your activities or well–being. A similar category are common goods: they belong to everybody. Hence, they tend to be overused since the cost of usage for one person is shared with everybody else. Think of congested roads: if I enter the highway with my car, I reduce the speed for everybody behind me, without having to pay for my contribution to the problem. It is the cars following me that have to bear the additional time costs that I cause. These examples illustrate that individual incentives and social goals are often in conflict with each other.</p>
<p>This also holds true for public goods. Consider a dyke that protects a village from the open sea. Here, there is no issue of compensation, because the services of the dyke (protection) can be consumed at the same time by all villagers and no-one can be excluded from using it. So, what would be the incentives to provide such a good if it belonged to a single individual that would have to bear all the cost of supplying the good? The problem is that it is individually rational not to provide the good, even though everybody benefits.</p>
<p>We shall discuss situations like these, since there is a clear role for the state to act and to coordinate. Notice, however, that property rights problems reach further. It not only must be clear who owns and is responsible for an economic good or an economic activity, but property rights must also be enforceable. One needs to have a well functioning judicial system that can impose sanctions wherever property rights are violated, and that can assign property rights wherever there is dispute.</p>
<p>Over and above such considerations, there are also intricate problems of international public good allocation where there is no supernational government or state that can do the coordination even though this may be needed.</p>

<h2 data-number="11.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="externalities"><span class="header-section-number">11.2</span> Externalities</h2>
<p>Externalities occur when the actions of consumers or firms impose costs or benefits on others who are not involved in the activity and that do not get compensated or do not have to pay.</p>
<p>Externalities can be positive or negative, and they can occur on the consumption side or on the production side, or both. They can be mutual as well. Focusing on negative production externalities, what we have in mind is that the productivity of firm <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> can suffer because of pollution from some other firm <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. Firm <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, as long as firm <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> does not have the right to a non-polluted environment, will experience a positive effect on its own production when it pollutes not least because it will not need to clean up. It does not need to clean up because the environment does not belong to <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, who therefore cannot demand compensation payments from <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. In terms of the production function examples of <a href="#fig-prod" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;5.1</a>, firm <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>’s technology when it does not need to clean up is the dotted curve in the top-left panel, and when it does need to clean up, the solid curve applies. Conversely, firm <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is confronted with an external cost caused by the pollution of firm <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. Its production is diminished when it suffers from <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>’s pollution.</p>

<p><a href="#fig-ext" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;11.1</a> shows a downward sloping marginal benefit curve and an upward sloping marginal cost curve, the marginal private cost represent opportunity costs of production. But in addition, the level of production also is associated with marginal damage done to others. The associated marginal damage cost or marginal external cost should be taken into account from society’s perspective. Hence we need to vertically aggregate up the marginal cost of production and the marginal external cost to arrive at the marginal social cost of production. <a href="#fig-ext" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;11.1</a> shows that the marginal social cost curve is steeper than the marginal private cost curve and the ensuing optimal allocation will equalize the marginal benefits with marginal social cost. This determines the socially optimal level of production (and pollution). The private market equilibrium, however, equalizes marginal benefit with marginal private cost, and the associated equilibrium quantity exceeds the optimal quantity.</p>
<p>By aggregating marginal external costs and marginal production costs into a single social cost measure, one can assess the overall impact of an economic activity, taking into account both the private and external costs. A welfare cost or deadweight loss triangle results between the smaller, socially efficient level of production and the higher, privately rational level.</p>

<h2 data-number="11.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="policy-options"><span class="header-section-number">11.3</span> Policy Options</h2>
<p>There are various ways or policy options that governments could apply in order to reduce the discrepancy between the private market outcome and the socially desirable optimal allocation. One of those options is to provide financial incentives through the tax system: we can consider to tax the externality-causing production or we can consider to subsidize abatement (meaning the reduction of pollution). Another possibility is quantity-directed and tries to tackle emissions directly. One can think of some sort of command-and-control quantity regulation where the government prescribes a tolerable level of pollution at the level of the individual firm. This will likely be inefficient. An alternative is to introduce a market for pollution permits where a market price for tradable permits allocates the right to pollute in the most cost efficient way. A cap on the total number of permits can be regulated by the government thus the state is in control of the total level of pollution. Lastly, and similar to the tax solution is an emissions fee that gives incentives through tax savings from abatement.</p>

<p>The canonical tax solution follows the idea of A.C. <span class="smallcaps">Pigou</span> in that it charges a tax per unit on a polluting producer’s output equal to the marginal damage that it causes at the socially optimal level of production. This tax essentially introduces a price on the externality that the polluter has to pay. The aim of a <span class="smallcaps">Pigov</span>ian tax is to internalize the external costs into the decision-making process of the polluting firms. This way the government can align social and private costs of the polluter.</p>
<!-- Two Column Setup _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ -->
<div class="grid">
<div class="g-col-6">
<p><br></p>
<p><a href="#fig-Pigou" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;11.2</a> illustrates. The tax is levied on production and paid by firms. We consider a unit tax (a constant amount paid on each unit produced, irrespective of the extent of production). This will shift the marginal private cost curve of firms up. This way, the relevant cost that firms are optimizing against include their private production cost and the tax. The equilibrium including the tax will be found where the marginal benefit equals the marginal private cost plus tax. This tax-inclusive equilibrium will lie to the left of the no-tax private market equilibrium, a bit closer perhaps to the socially efficient quantity. The optimal tax reduces the activity such that the welfare loss from the externality is exactly removed.</p>
<p>The main problem with such a tax solution is in the implementation: it needs to have both pollutants and pollutees to truthfully reveal their private costs and benefits so that taxes can be set optimally.</p>
<p>Note that the <span class="smallcaps">Pigov</span>ian tax also generates government revenue that can be used for financing public goods.</p>
<p>Conversely, instead of specifying the desired level of production, one may specify the desired level of abatement (i.e., reduction of pollution). Subsidizing the abatement will also increase the marginal private cost, because the marginal value of <em>not abating</em> carries a cost of <em>foregone</em> subsidy. The optimal subsidy increases abatement such that the welfare loss from the externality is again exactly removed.</p>

<p>One perhaps at first sight obvious approach to environmental policy and pollution reduction is to consider a one-size-fits all quantity regulation program. Here, firms are restricted in terms of the quantity that they may produce in that they cannot exceed a pre-specified level of production. This may work if the government knows exactly the optimal extent of production and if all firms are homogeneous. Homogeneous firms have the same production technology and hence the same cost structure. Yet, it is more likely that firms differ in terms of production technology and cost structure and therefore we need to consider how to optimally allocate across firms a desired extent of total quantity in the market.</p>

<!-- Two Column Setup _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ -->
<div class="grid">
<div class="g-col-6">
<p><br> It is intuitive that a condition for an optimal allocation is the equalization of marginal cost across firms. But if cost structures differ between firms then an equalization of marginal cost is unlikely associated with an equalization of quantities across firms. This is illustrated in <a href="#fig-2cost" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;11.3</a> where we have two firms <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> &amp; <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> with different marginal cost functions, and we have a limited output target <span class="math inline">\(\bar q\)</span> in the industry.</p>
<p>The picture is similar to an <span class="smallcaps">Edgeworth</span> box: we combine the marginal costs of both firms by flipping around the graph for one of the firms (in our example firm <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, so we read the quantity on the axis for firm <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> from the right to the left). The picture shows the case of increasing marginal cost for both firms. To understand that any allocation that deviates from an equalization of marginal cost across firms is sub-optimal consider that total cost of production across both firms are not being minimized given the output level. The picture allows to toggle the total cost and represent them as areas under the marginal cost curves. When sliding the target quantity it will be intuitive that cost minimization requires equalization of marginal costs across firms.</p>

<p>Hence, with heterogeneous firms, there is no reason to expect that regulating quantities uniformly across firms delivers efficient outcomes. However, our picture <a href="#fig-2cost" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;11.3</a> does show heterogeneous firms for whom a uniform quantity regulation <em>happens</em> to be optimal. Slide the total quantity <span class="math inline">\(\bar q\)</span> to be produced a bit to the left to understand that uniformity is not optimal at any other level of <span class="math inline">\(\bar q\)</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Pigov</span>ian taxes are a market-based mechanism to address negative externalities, providing economic agents with a financial incentive to reduce their harmful activities.</p>
<p>An emissions trading system (ETS) is another market-based mechanism to control and reduce pollution. It starts with issuance of certificates that embody the “right to pollute”. This way, the holder has a property right over pollution, and can trade (sell) this right. The system then operates within a market framework, allowing firms to buy and sell emission allowances.</p>
<p>The regulatory authority sets an overall cap on the total allowable emissions. We can imagine this to be proportional to <span class="math inline">\(\bar q\)</span>, for instance <span class="math inline">\(0.2\bar q\)</span>. The cap is usually set to decrease over time to achieve emission reduction targets.</p>
<p>The regulator also allocates a certain number of emission allowances or permits to each firm. The allowances add up to the total cap. If every firm gets the same number of permits, we are basically back in the situation of the uniform quantity regulation. The difference is, that firms can now trade their rights. Firms that can reduce emissions more efficiently and at a lower cost may choose to do so and then sell their surplus allowances to firms facing higher abatement costs, who in turn buy them. Then, by the interaction of supply and demand for permits, a market-clearing price for emission permits is established. Since firms adapt quantities given the price, all marginal costs are equalized across firms, even if their production technology differs. The system encourages businesses to find the least expensive way to reduce emissions.</p>
<p>In a next year or round, the regulator can then buy back permits and reduce the overall allowable quantity in the market, hence directly conrolling overall emissions. This can be important when certain targets are specified in, say, international treaties. <a href="#fig-2cost" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;11.3</a> allows readers to simulate the reduction of the overall allowable quantity by changing <span class="math inline">\(\bar q\)</span>.</p>
<p>Recent history has shown that the ‘price of carbon’ was too low—so regulators needed to take action and take permits out of circulation, i.e.&nbsp;lower the cap. This will tend to increase the price of a permit over time, so that there is a clear incentive to innovate and invest in cleaner technologies. Note: this price-increasing effect is not visible in the animation of <a href="#fig-2cost" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;11.3</a>, because it only reduces production and not actual permits. The way to think about it is that emissions permits per <span class="math inline">\(\bar q\)</span> will be reduced (say, from <span class="math inline">\(0.2\bar q\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(0.1\bar q\)</span>), while <span class="math inline">\(\bar q\)</span> stays constant.</p>
<p>Similar to a <span class="smallcaps">Pigov</span>ian tax, the government could instead levy an emissions fee on the pollution associated with production. This surcharge works like a tax and hence introduces a uniform price on polluting. Firms can save taxes by abating (pollution reduction) and they would pollute only for those units where paying taxes instead is cheaper than abating more. Again this mechanism achieves cost efficiency between firms since firms for whom it is cheapest to abate will abate most. The worst polluters then pay the highest tax bill. To some extent this is equivalent to the cap-and-trade model, but gives incomplete control over changing circumstances (e.g., inflation requires discretionary tax hikes).</p>
<p>In summary, both <span class="smallcaps">Pigov</span>ian taxes, or emissions fees, but also emission permits issued within a cap-and-trade system are market-based approaches for addressing negative externalities from environmental pollution, and all achieve cost efficiency. The ETS may be associated with price volatility and potential distributional issues (who gets what at the initial allocation?). In contrast, <span class="smallcaps">Pigov</span>ian taxes are simpler to implement but it may be harder to achieve set emission targets in a particular time frame.</p>

<h2 data-number="11.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-pgoods"><span class="header-section-number">11.4</span> Public Goods</h2>
<p>Public goods belong to the category of goods that are contributing potentially much to social welfare, yet there is no mechanism that ensures that the market will provide the efficient amount of such goods. The deep reason is that their characteristics do not give selfish individuals sufficient incentives to supply such goods. In particular, public goods are non-rival in consumption and non-excludable. Underprovision of public goods is one of the prime examples of market failure.</p>
<p>That does not mean, however, that such goods are not produced by private companies. Likewise, there are many goods that are supplied by the state without being proper public goods. Think of education, for instance, where there is clearly excludability, and to some extent rivalry for scarce resources. In some countries, like the U.S., privately supplied education is a major industry. In other countries, it is publicly provided, and yet would have to be classified as a private good. Similar remarks apply to health care or public services at the local level. These semi- or quasi-public goods are often provided for by the state since there are important externalities that lead to a wrong allocation by market parties alone.</p>

<p><a href="#fig-publicprivate" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;11.4</a> provides a classification of economic goods according to two dimensions: rivalry and excludability. We consider four extremes. Type <strong>A</strong> is the case of a pure private or individual good. It is entirely excludable and perfectly rival. Most goods that are analyzed in economics fall in this category. For the sake of example, think of a glass of water. Whenever Mary drinks that particular glass, John cannot drink the same glass (rivalry), and whenever Mary does not want John to drink from her glass she has the right to deny consumption to him. If needed, we assume, property rights can be perfectly enforced in court.</p>

<p>Type <strong>B</strong> is the polar case of a pure public good. They are non-rival in consumption and non-excludable. Think of dams, dykes and dunes as examples, or the world oceans (perhaps outside the coastal area). A dune that protects the coast at Egmond–aan–Zee and Bergen–aan–Zee will also protect the inhabitants of Alkmaar. Even if it ‘belonged’ to the citizens of Egmond and Bergen, they could not exclude the inhabitants of Alkmaar from benefiting from it. Likewise, the fact that Alkmaar benefits from it does not impose additional costs from an existing dune to Bergen. The example of the dune illustrates another salient feature of public goods: you tend not to notice them, except when they fail. See the various disasters in the wake of climate change (floodings, droughts, etc.).</p>
<p>More generally, many of the tasks of the public sector have to do with provisions of public goods. Among them, we may count the more obvious ones such as national defense, public order and security, or public health, but also provision of a judicial system and a public administration, or even redistribution of incomes.</p>
<p>Of course, there are categories of goods that fall in between types <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>. They are sometimes called “impure” public goods. We consider two of these: type <strong>C</strong> is that of a <em>club good</em> and type <strong>D</strong> is often referred to as <em>common good</em>. Club goods are only available to members of a club. Suppose you are member of a tennis club, you may benefit from the club and its facilities without necessarily imposing a cost on others. In that sense, there is no or little rivalry. You can and will be excluded, however, if you do not pay your membership fees. Admittedly, many sports clubs do suffer from rivalry, as can be observed: you may have to book a slot for playing a long time in advance. However, this is intimately related to the price the club charges as member fees. If that price is high, there will be fewer people wanting to become a member. The fact that the tennis club is excludable is a technical characteristic that enables scarcity pricing. Clubs are important empirical forms of social organization (think of international associations of states such as EU, the eurozone, the OECD or NATO).</p>
<p>Common goods are obviously a concern to economists. The commons share the feature that there is no technology available at non–prohibitive cost that keeps other people from consuming the good which is in principle rival. Famous examples are deep sea fishing or using national highways. If there are too many boats fishing in the same fishing grounds, fish may become extinct (overfishing). If there are too many cars entering the highway, this may lead to traffic jams. That is, because no-one is effectively excluded, no price can be charged. But if no price can be charged to ration users then everyone will have an incentive to use and consume the good to an extent that is not optimal: the resource will be overused and possibly disappear. This effect is called the “tragedy of the commons”.</p>
<p>Even though of core interest to public economists, we shall not further discuss club goods or common goods. Instead, we close with remarking that there are many other types of goods between the four extremes of <a href="#fig-publicprivate" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;11.4</a>, most of which do not have a special name, though. Both rivalry and excludability are a matter of degrees, and some goods can transition from one category to the other. This can happen, for instance, when an exclusion technology becomes available at lower cost, or when a non-rival resource becomes rival because the number of users increases (think of a beach and how its rivalry changes with the seasons). Likewise, it is not always obvious how to draw the line between an externality and a public good (or public bad) or a common good (some authors consider common resources as a form of externality).</p>
<p>We shall now turn to the important question of how to determine the efficient level of provision of a public good. It will then become clear in <a href="#sec-problems" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;11.7</a> that market coordination is not sufficient to supply an efficient level of a public good.</p>

<h2 data-number="11.6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-provision"><span class="header-section-number">11.6</span> Public Goods: Efficient Level of Provision</h2>
<p>The efficient level of provision of a private good is typically determined by conditions of perfect competition (marginal cost pricing) where market demand equals market supply. To arrive at market demand, we need to <em>aggregate</em> individual demands. Recall horizontal aggregation for private goods in <a href="#fig-demagg" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;6.1</a>.</p>
<p>Note that in market equilibrium, where supply equals demand, all individuals consume different quantities, but they pay the same (relative) price. In fact, market equilibrium is attained by the price reacting to differences in supply and demand. A market–clearing price will establish itself when the market is competitive. The story is altogether different for public goods.</p>
<p><a href="#fig-publicdemand" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;11.5</a> shows the aggregation over individuals for public goods, when there are two individuals <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. Denote individual demand schedules as <span class="math inline">\(D_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D_B\)</span>. Recall that demand measures “willingness to pay”, i.e.&nbsp;how much each person is at most prepared to spend on a given unit of the good. We therefore use the inverse demand schedules <span class="math inline">\(P()\)</span> that express prices as functions of quantities: <span class="math inline">\(P_A(G)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P_B(G)\)</span>. Instead of <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>, we use the symbol <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> to indicate quantities of public goods.</p>
<!-- Two Column Setup _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ -->
<div class="grid">
<div class="g-col-6">
<p>Since a public good is non-rival, each unit consumed by either <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> can at the same time, and without implications for the consumption possibilities of the other person, be consumed by <em>both</em> persons. Therefore, the only way to efficiently decide on a consumption allocation is that indeed both persons will consume the same units. We should not add up horizontally the units over the individuals. Instead, the abscissa values (the <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> axis) need to be the same, for both individuals, and for the aggregate. We instead consider the willingness to pay, which is the vertical axis of the graphs. Since both <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> have their individual willingness to pay <span class="math inline">\(P_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P_B\)</span>, the aggregate willingness to pay is the (vertical) sum of both, <span class="math inline">\(P_A+P_B\)</span>. Note that the total demand function will be steeper than the individual demand functions, not flatter as was the case with private goods (compare <a href="#fig-demagg" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;6.1</a>).</p>

<p>The efficient level of provision is found where aggregate demand and supply coincide. Note that in this situation, both persons consume the same quantity, even though their willingness to pay differs, <span class="math inline">\(p_A^\star \neq p_B^\star\)</span> in general. The total willingness to pay for the efficient level of provision <span class="math inline">\(G^\star\)</span> equals <span class="math inline">\(P^\star\)</span>. Unlike in <a href="#fig-demagg" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;6.1</a>, however, there is no automatic market clearing to be expected.</p>
<p>From the optimal allocation at <span class="math inline">\(G^\star\)</span> we can now go back to the individual inverse demand schedules and determine the price that we would charge the individuals: <span class="math inline">\(p_A = P_A(G^\star)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_B = P_B(G^\star)\)</span>, i.e., each consumer is charged with a price equal to their individual marginal willingness to pay.</p>
<p>Summarizing, let us repeat the main difference between pure private and pure public goods as far as determining the efficient level of provision is concerned: demand for private goods will be <em>horizontally</em> aggregated (as in <a href="#fig-demagg" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;6.1</a>) whereas demand for public goods will be <em>vertically</em> aggregated (as in <a href="#fig-publicdemand" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;11.5</a>). If we use the term <em>marginal benefit</em> (MB) for individual demand or “willingness to pay” schedules and <em>marginal cost</em> (MC) for supply curves, the efficient provision of a public good <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is given by the so–called</p>

<p>Determining the optimal contribution of an individual to the financing of the public good is one thing. Making people pay is an altogether different story. Let us now illustrate the problem of two individuals voluntarily contributing to a public good. Consider the example of two students that wish to acquire a common resource, such as a TV set for their shared living room. Clearly, both students can watch TV at the same time, and since the TV set is located in a common area, neither can be excluded from consumption. (Let us for the sake of the example assume away any problems from selecting which program to watch). Now, suppose the TV set can be rented at a cost of 10€ per month, and each student has a private valuation of 8€ per month. If the TV set is acquired (rented), the person(s) that sign(s) the rental contract pays. So, if both sign the contract, both pay 5€ each, leaving a net benefit of 3€ per person per month. If only one of the students signs the rental contract, he or she pays, and the other one gets a free ride. Net benefits in this case are <span class="math inline">\(-2\)</span> for the one who pays, and <span class="math inline">\(8\)</span> for the other one. If no-one pays for the TV set, there will be nothing to watch, and benefits are <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.</p>

<p>Suppose, player 1 expects player 2 to choose ‘pay’, then his or her possible pay–offs are <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(8\)</span>, respectively. In that case, player 1 will choose ‘do not pay’ since this yields a higher pay–off for himself. Similar for the situation where player 2 is thought to choose ‘do not pay’. Also here, player 1 better chooses ‘do not pay’ since his associated pay–off is higher (<span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>) than that from choosing ‘pay’ (<span class="math inline">\(-2\)</span>). That is to say, independently of the choice of player 2, player 1 always chooses ‘do not pay’. This is a <em>dominant strategy</em>. ‘Pay’ is the <em>dominated strategy</em>.</p>
<p>The same holds true for player 2, since the game is symmetric. Hence, both choose ‘do not pay’ as their equilibrium strategies. This equilibrium is also a <span class="smallcaps">Nash</span> equilibrium: in the sense that each player chooses his or her optimal strategy given the optimal choice of the other player. Note that the equilibrium is not <span class="smallcaps">Pareto</span> efficient: both players could be made better off if they were to choose ‘pay’. In that case, each had a pay–off of <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> instead of <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. However, this strategy choice is not a wise one from the individual’s point of view: I know that you have an incentive to defect to ‘do not pay’ once I choose ‘pay’. Therefore, it is in my own best interest to choose not to pay. Same reasoning applies to you. The prisoner’s dilemma is one of the simplest and most intuitive ways to show that what may be collectively rational (i.e., leading to the <span class="smallcaps">Pareto</span> improvement), need not be individually rational. Hence, to implement the collectively rational strategy combination, we may need a government, that is, an impartial institution that sits ‘above’ the players.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Pushing the thought a bit further, one can argue that coordination for non-market allocations is a prime task for policy. Indeed, one can think of numerous examples where governments act as mediators and coordinate the actions of different parties, whether this concerns pure public goods (coordination on climate protocols, international coordination of crime watch and crime deterrence) or not (coordination in wage negotiations between unions and employer associations).</p>
<p>Of course, the outcome of the game in <a href="#tbl-prisoner" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;11.1</a> depends on a number of implicit assumptions we have made. These are, among others, that none of the players can commit to a particular strategy and that no binding agreements can effectively be made. Also, we assume that the game is only played once, that is it is not possible to establish a reputation as a ‘good guy’ by choosing ‘pay’ which may persuade the other person also to ‘pay’. Reputation can help when there is an implicit threat: I play ‘pay’ as long as you do. If you defect and play ‘do not pay’ only for a single time, I will punish you and never ‘pay’ again myself.</p>

<h2 data-number="11.8" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="global-public-goods"><span class="header-section-number">11.8</span> Global Public Goods</h2>
<p>We have so far ruled out coordination between players by assumption. We have alluded to the possibility that the government, sitting atop private agents, can effectively coordinate. For global or transnational public goods, this possibility is excluded, since there is no effective government at the supernational level that can enforce certain actions for individual, sovereign states to take. All action will be voluntary. Once provided, no country can be prevented from enjoying a global public good; nor can any country’s enjoyment of the good impinge on the consumption opportunities of other countries. This makes it immediately obvious that solving the issue of public good provision at a global level, such as climate change policies, is inherently complex, perhaps doomed to fail. If provided, global public goods make citizens better off everywhere, but we may have doubts they will be provided.</p>
<p>There are three essential changes we may want to consider when thinking about how to model a game theoretic interaction between countries in the context of environmental damages, where much of the global public good debate takes place.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>As in <a href="#tbl-prisoner" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;11.1</a>, the pay-off structure depends on costs and benefits accruing to individual players. Whereas we had assumed in the construction of <a href="#tbl-prisoner" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;11.1</a> that costs were fixed and benefits were private, when actions are ‘pollute’ or ‘abate’ (rather than ‘pay’ or ‘do not pay’), abatement is costly effort of the player in question. Hence, the cost are private. The benefits, conversely, spill over to the other player: one country polluting may benefit from its neighboring country’s abatement effort; if the same country also abates, it receives twice the benefit of individual abatement. Hence, benefits are non-rivalrous and non-excludable.</li>
<li>There are typically more than 2 players. The world has around 200 countries or sovereign nations, all of them are affected in one way or other by climate change. There is no way we can construct and display a 200-dimensional pay-off matrix. If we make the drastically simplifying assumption that all <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> players are symmetric (identical), the problem is manageable, however, and not more involved than the 2-player game in <a href="#tbl-prisoner" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;11.1</a>. In fact, the conclusion will stay the same, as long as the pay-off structure is preserved (i.e.&nbsp;abatement is individually dominated by pollution).</li>
<li>Countries can and do cooperate, and total pay-offs from cooperation can be split (in <a href="#tbl-prisoner" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;11.1</a>, coordinating on {pay; pay} gives average pay-offs of 3 as opposed to 0 from {don’t pay; don’t pay}). However, countries will also consider whether joining a cooperation with others is worth it, or whether the pay-offs from free-riding on the other countries are higher.</li>
</ol>
<p>The treaty solution of international environmental agreements proposes a 3-stage approach to model the constellation with <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> countries. They can join an international treaty or agreement that specifies that all <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> members of the club commit to abate, and that gains of cooperation will be split among them. However, whether or not a country is a member, is the country’s own choice. Hence, the number of signatories <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> to the treaty is <em>endogenous</em>. There will be <span class="math inline">\(N-k\)</span> non-signatories.</p>
<p>Summarizing, the three stages are as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>non-cooperative stage: each country decides unilaterally whether or not to join / sign the treaty</li>
<li>cooperative stage: the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> signatories of the treaty ‘abate’ and share the gains</li>
<li>non-cooperative stage: the <span class="math inline">\(N-k\)</span> non-signatories decide unilaterally whether to ‘abate’ or ‘pollute’</li>
</ol>
<p>3. The solution starts from the last step. To make the game realistic, we assume that the pay-off structure is such that once a country decides to be out, it is individually rational to pollute rather than to abate, that is in non-cooperative play ‘pollute’ dominates ‘abate’.<br> 2. for any number of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> inside the treaty, we determine the pay-off structure (because the total benefits to be shared depend on <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, this needs to be considered for any <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>) and the pay-off from cooperating<br> 1. determine <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> by asking per individual player: is it worth to join the treaty and ‘abate’, or are the payoffs from staying out and ‘polluting’ higher?</p>
<p>The solution can be a stable number of treaty participants <span class="math inline">\(k^\star\)</span> where no signatory has an incentive to leave and no non-signatory has an incentive to join. This stability implies that the agreement is <em>self-enforcing</em>, that is, the number <span class="math inline">\(k^\star\)</span> is in equilibrium.</p>
<p>Note, however, that whereas the precise number of signatories will depend on the relation between cost and benefits that enter the pay-off determination, <span class="math inline">\(k^\star\)</span> is in almost all cases quite small relative to <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>. That is, only a few volunteers will provide the public good and many free-riders will reap some limited benefits without incurring effort cost themselves. This conclusion suggests that global public goods, such as those that are to reduce (the impact of) climate change, remain very difficult to provide.</p>

<div style="display:none">
<span class="math inline">\(\nextSection\)</span>
</div>
<p>This chapter is concerned with the type of competition that one may expect depending on the composition of the industry under consideration. We distinguish typically the following types of market structure according to the number of firms and/or their concentration (perhaps measured as the contribution of a firm to the total turnover of all firms in the industry):</p>
<ul>
<li>Perfect competition with (infinitely) many, atomistic firms (the case discussed in <a href="#sec-compsupply" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;5.4</a>).</li>
<li>Monopoly with just a single (dominating) firm.</li>
<li>Oligopoly with more than one but often only a handful of relevant firms.</li>
</ul>
<p>We shall now discuss monopoly, and its special case the natural monopoly, as well as the duopoly (market with two firms) as a special case of the oligopoly.</p>
<p>We shall also make the distinction between quantities produced by individual firms, denoted with a lower-case <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>, and quantity traded on the market, denoted with a capital <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, see <a href="#sec-equil" class="quarto-xref">Chapter&nbsp;6</a>. In particular in the oligopoly case, we also distinguish according to the strategic variable that firms choose. As we shall see, competition on price gives very different predictions and has very different welfare implications than competition on quantity.</p>

<h2 data-number="12.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-monopoly"><span class="header-section-number">12.1</span> Two Cases of Monopoly</h2>
<p>We now consider a monopolistic firm. In a static setting, there are no competitors to begin with, and we disregard the possibility that there is a threat of entry from firms that have not yet chosen to compete.</p>
<p>
To set the stage, it will be helpful to first return to the initial setting of <a href="#sec-profit" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;5.3</a>. If the firm in question is a profit-maximizing monopoly, then it has additional degrees of freedom over competitive firms because it can set its own price. However, it needs to obey the additional restriction <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:qdemand}\)</span>: A monopolistic firm cannot ignore the fact that demand decreases, precisely because it chooses the price and not only the quantity. As such, <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:MRMC}\)</span> still holds, but revenue <span class="math inline">\(R(Q)\)</span>, and in particular marginal revenue <span class="math inline">\(MR(Q)\)</span> differs from the competitive case discussed in <a href="#sec-compsupply" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;5.4</a>. Sales revenue (price times quantity), <span class="math display">\[
R(Q) = p\cdot Q = D^{-1}(Q)\cdot Q
\]</span> involves inverse demand <span class="math inline">\(D^{-1}(Q)\)</span>.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> To keep the exposition transparent, assume that market demand, and hence also its inverse, are both linear, and we use the simplified <span class="math inline">\(a-Q\)</span> instead of the generic <span class="math inline">\(D^{-1}(Q)\)</span>. Then, <span class="math display">\[R(Q) = (a-Q)\cdot Q.\]</span>
</p>
<p>What, then, is marginal revenue? This will depend on what the firm can do when it sets its price. The conceptually easiest way to understand marginal revenue is when each extra unit produced can be sold to the last willing consumer at her or his individual marginal willingness to pay. Since the downward-falling demand schedule orders consumers according to their willingness to pay, the first unit will be sold at the highest marginal willingness to pay, the second unit at the second highest marginal willingness to pay, and so on. It is then apparent, that the marginal revenue coincides with the marginal willingness to pay schedule observed in the market.</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>In order to understand this, look at <a href="#fig-discrimination" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;12.1</a>: It shows a monopoly with a zero marginal cost curve, without fixed cost, facing a downward-sloping demand curve. The marginal revenue for the first unit sold equals the first consumer’s willingness to pay for that unit. It is shown in blue as the vertical difference between demand and the horizontal axis at the marginal output.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>As the quantity supplied is increased, starting from zero, the marginal revenue curve drops simply because additional units can only be sold by decreasing the price <em>for those units</em> accordingly.</p>
<p>Note that this implies that every unit is sold at a different price. This requires the firm not only to observe the general shape of the demand curve, but also to identify each individual consumer’s willness to pay, and hence know whom to charge what. There are, in the limit, infinitely many prices. We call this situation <em>first-degree price discriminiation</em>, or perfect price discrimination. Pricing discriminates between consumers (units sold).</p>
<p>The situation of first-degree price discriminiation is perhaps special, since it requires the firm to know a lot about its customers.</p>

<p>If the firm cannot discriminate between customers and individual consumers’ willingness to pay cannot be directly observed, the firm may not be able to do better than charge the same price to all.</p>
<p>This defines the <em>standard monopoly</em> case. However, it also implies an additional effect on marginal revenue, since the expanding output implies that in order to sell an additional unit, the monopolist must lower the price not just on that additional (marginal) unit, but also on all prior (inframarginal) units it wants to sell.</p>
<p>
This can be seen mathematically as follows: marginal revenue (using the product rule) is <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\label{eq:MRmonop}
MR(Q) = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}q} R(Q)  = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}q} \left[(a-Q)\cdot Q \right]
=
\left[\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}Q} (a-Q) \right] \cdot Q
+
(a-Q) \cdot \left[\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}Q} Q \right]
= (-1)\cdot Q + (a-Q)\cdot 1 = a-2Q.
\end{equation}\]</span> Note that the marginal revenue function is twice as steep (slope of <span class="math inline">\(-2\)</span>) as inverse demand (slope of <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>), as evident from <a href="#fig-monopoly" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;12.2</a>. Combining this equation with the profit-maximizing condition (marginal revenue equals marginal cost <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:MRMC}\)</span>) allows us to determine the monopolist’s supplied quantity from <span class="math display">\[a-2Q=MC(Q)\]</span> which we can solve for <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>. Let’s denote the solution by <span class="math inline">\(Q^m\)</span>. It is clear then that the standard monopolist does not have a supply-of-output function, but only a point of supply. The equilibrium price is <span class="math display">\[p^m = D^{-1}(Q^m)=a-Q^m.\]</span>

<p>Look at <a href="#fig-monopoly" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;12.2</a> and shift the movable <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> dot on the horizontal axis to understand how revenue and marginal revenue evolves as the quantity is being expanded in the non-discriminating case. The graph is drawn under the same parameter settings as <a href="#fig-discrimination" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;12.1</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the standard monopoly case, marginal revenue drops quicker than consumers’ willingness to pay through the additional price effect on inframarginal units. That is, the marginal revenue is the vertical difference between demand and the horizontal axis at the marginal output, <em>minus</em> the horizontal red bar, that we have copied over as a vertical red colored bar. What is left of marginal revenue is the blue vertical bit. This renders marginal revenue twice as steep as demand.</p>
<p>The equilibrium of the monopoly is determined by setting marginal revenue equal to marginal cost. At that point profit is maximized. Press the toggle button in <a href="#fig-monopoly" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;12.2</a> once to see this: the blue profit box has maximum area. Unlike the perfectly price discriminating firm in <a href="#fig-discrimination" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;12.1</a>, the standard monopolist will not expand output further, since doing so would then decrease its profit. At the equilibrium quantity, the firm will set a uniform price equal to the willingness to pay of the marginal consumer, hence the price is the highest possible price the firm could charge, given the quantity that it chooses to produce.</p>
<p>
If there are no fixed cost, the firm makes a profit (equal to producer surplus), indicated by the blue area. Its area is the difference between price and marginal costs, times the quantity. If there are fixed cost, then average cost become important, and the firm’s profit equals the difference between price and average cost, times the quantity. Compare <a href="#sec-compsupply" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;5.4</a>. We revisit the issue when discussing the natural monopoly, <a href="#sec-natmono" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;12.3</a>.

<li>the firm has a clear incentive to increase its production to the point where the last unit sold has a price equal to marginal cost, so pricing is efficient, and</li>

</ol>
<p>In other words, there is a classic trade-off between efficiency and inequality (since all surplus goes to the owners of the firm).</p>
<p>In case of a non-discriminating, standard monopoly, there will be a welfare loss, depicted as red triangle in <a href="#fig-monopoly" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;12.2</a> (press the toggle button a second time to see it). This is because the equilibrium quantity is too low relative to the efficient quantity choice (marginal cost pricing). The units above the equilibrium quantity up to the efficient quantity could all be produced and sold to consumers against a price that covers marginal cost, but our calculus shows that profit maximization implies restricting the quantity supplied.</p>

<p>One last aspect worth discussing is so-called <em>double marginalization</em>. Imagine the monopolistic firm’s marginal cost of production reflect the price it needs to pay its own suppliers when it buys input on the market. An example is a retailer selling to consumers and buying from a wholesaler. Now, let that wholesale market be non-competitive as well, for simplicity again a standard monopolist. Then, there are two layers of monopolist: the wholesale supplier of the intermediate good (input) and the retail supplier of the output. But the wholesale supplier overcharges relative to competitive pricing, driving up marginal cost of the retailer. This way, the layered structure of the monopolist implies a much higher welfare loss, and lower profit than was the case in the standard monopoly.</p>
<p>The geometric reason is that the welfare loss of the standard monopolist under constant marginal cost is a simple triangle, see <a href="#fig-monopoly" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;12.2</a>. If the wholesale vendor charges a markup over marginal production cost, this will artificially increase the marginal cost of the retailer, and the additional welfare loss is being added from the point where there aready is a substantial welfare loss to begin with. So, the extra welfare loss comes on top a pre-existing distortion, making a bad thing worse.</p>

<p>
A natural monopoly differs from the standard monopoly because very high fixed cost play a particular role. Those can cause that there are no competitors that want to enter the market. Whereas a standard monopoly earns (very) high profits and attracts entry in the long run, which in turn may result in competitive marginal cost pricing, a natural monopoly is characterized by the fact that entry is not viable, and competition fails to take hold. The reason is that every entrant to the market would also have to incur the fixed cost. Such duplication of fixed cost reduces the profit making possibilities for the firm. In fact, trying to squeeze a second firm into the market is then ineffcient, since the added fixed cost cannot be recouped.
</p>
<p>
In network industries high fixed cost are very relevant. For instance, railways face high fixed cost due to the rail tracks, whereas variable costs are associated with transportation of passengers and cargo. The large fixed cost have to be incurred even if no cargo and no passengers are being transported. The problem with not being able to introduce competition into such a market becomes obvious when a second supplier would have to install their own network infrastructure and hence duplicate the fixed cost in the industry. With limited demand, such a duplication may never pay off.

Conversely, we can say that demand plays a particular role. The possibility to sell any quantity to consumers depends on demand relative to average cost. Suppose demand would shrink, then the entire graph scales down and there will be a point where profit is zero or even turns into a loss. At that point, the firm stops producing. In other words, if there are fixed cost, then both relatively high fixed cost or relatively low demand may make the monopoly unprofitable. A monopolist without any fixed costs can always profitably supply an inefficiently low quantity to the market.

Constant marginal cost imply that the average cost curve is globally falling, having marginal cost as asymptote as <span class="math inline">\(Q\to\infty\)</span>. This was the case in <a href="#fig-natmono" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;12.4</a>. Now consider <a href="#fig-natmono2" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;12.5</a> where marginal cost is increasing. Similar to the situation in <a href="#fig-compsupply" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;5.4</a>, the increasing marginal cost curve cuts the average cost curve in its minimum. This is because variable cost get relatively more important, and fixed cost relatively less important, so that the average cost curve slopes upward eventually. If demand intersects average cost in its upward sloping part, marginal cost pricing may become possible. If demand intersects average cost in its downward sloping part, monopolistic pricing above marginal cost will result.

<p><a href="#fig-subadd" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;12.6</a> illustrates why accommodating more than a single supplier under large fixed cost and constant marginal cost is challenging. The effect is known as <em>subadditivity</em>.</p>

<p>Suppose we aim to produce the double quantity of <span class="math inline">\(2Q_0\)</span>.

<p>However, if there is only one firm producing <span class="math inline">\(2Q_0\)</span>, the expansion of production under the same technology helps exploiting the downward trajectory of the average cost curve, and total cost is equal to the green rectangle.

<p>
</p><p>Structural absence of competition because of duplication of fixed cost means we shall have to live with a monopoly. In order to move the social outcome away from the inefficient monopoly equilibrium, we can consider regulation. Regulation can come in various forms. One form is marginal cost price regulation where a regulator stipulates that the firm charges a price equal to its marginal cost. We will see that this is associated with making losses given the fixed cost. To prevent the firm from leaving the market, the losses need to be covered somehow, for instance, fixed cost could be subsidized by the taxpayer.</p>
Another possibility is so-called <span class="smallcaps">Ramsey</span> pricing. Here, the regulator allows the firm to set an average cost price, making zero profit. Even at the maximally possible quantity that affords the firm a profit of zero, one still retains a welfare loss. This welfare loss is the smallest possible, however, such that the firm is still willing to operate in the market rather than to leave. In that sense, this type of pricing is called second best, it minimizes the welfare loss incurred under the constraint that the firm is having enough incentives to keep operating in the market.
<p></p>

<p>
</p><p>Let’s look at <a href="#fig-Ramsey" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;12.7</a>. Three areas are shaded, the profit of the firm is visible in blue, the welfare loss of monopoly in red, and the consumer surplus triangle in green.</p>
<p>To price-regulate the firm, the regulator sets a price <span class="math inline">\(p_{reg}\)</span> (for regulated price) that the firm can charge to consumers. The firm has an incentive to expand its output until at the last unit sold the price it receives equals consumers’ willingness to pay.</p>
<p>We start in <a href="#fig-Ramsey" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;12.7</a> at the unregulated equilibrium price of the monopolist. If the regulator chooses a price that the firm would have chosen anyway, we are not surprised to see that the quantity of the firm under regulation, <span class="math inline">\(Q_{firm}\)</span>, is unaffected. However, consider a downward move in the regulator’s price <span class="math inline">\(p_{reg}\)</span>. This price reduction leads to an increase of the quantity that the firm is producing. The profit decreases simply because we move away from the profit maximizing point of supply of the unregulated monopolist. At the same time, consumer surplus increases, and the welfare loss of monopoly decreases. If we measure the success of regulation by the reduction of the welfare loss, decreasing the price is a good thing.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(p_{reg}\)</span> can be brought down to the point where it equals average cost. At that level we have a very large triangle of consumer surplus, zero profit, and a small welfare loss.</p>
<p>Of course, the regulator could now try to reduce <span class="math inline">\(p_{reg}\)</span> even further to marginal cost.</p>

<p>Here, the question arises: to what extent is the firm still willing to expand its output? Note that the firm has actually no incentive to further increase its output because at any price lower than the average cost it will make a negative average profit. The loss is indicated by the long, green-blueish thin rectangle. Whereas consumer surplus appears to increase, the loss-making firm would stop producing, <span class="math inline">\(Q_{firm}\)</span> jumps to zero, and the green consumer surplus triangle would disappear.</p>
<p>The regulator will want the firm to stay in the game and has to allow it to make at least zero profits. Zero economic profits imply that the opportunity of making higher profits elsewhere is absent. Absent such an opportunity, we may assume that the firm stays in the market when it makes zero profit.</p>
<p>This requirement is met at the average cost price. Hence, average cost pricing is in some sense the best we can hope for under the conditions of natural monopoly. And we’ll have to live with a small <em>second best</em> welfare loss.</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>Named after Frank <span class="smallcaps">Ramsey</span>, the second-best approach to price regulation of a natural monopoly involves the regulator setting a (maximum) price that the firm can charge to its customers equal to the average cost that obtain where the demand curve intersects the downward-sloping average cost curve. Since marginal cost lies entirely below average cost, the <span class="smallcaps">Ramsey</span> pricing regulation allows a positive markup of price above marginal cost: <span class="math inline">\(p_{reg}&gt;MC\)</span>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>There are other types of regulations that are being used in practice. One of them is called cost-plus regulation. Here, the regulator limits the price that the monopolist can set. The limit is based on reported explicit cost and allows for some markup.</p>
<p>Alternatively, there is rate of return regulation where the price is maximized by having a ceiling on the return to capital that the firm can earn.</p>
<p>Another possibility entails auctioning off a license to operate in the market, by way of a government-run procurement auction. This approach is also known as the mechanism of franchise bidding. Before opening the monopolistic market, there will be competition among several bidders that bid for having the right to operate in that market. In total, those bidders would want to pay a price equal to the future expected profits that are possible in the monopolistic market. Since that price payment will be collected by the government, the government essentially creams off the future rents at the very early stage.</p>

<p>We now shift gears and assume that two firms can profitably operate in the market. Fixed cost may be absent or small enough so that the issues discussed in <a href="#sec-natmono" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;12.3</a> do not arise and regulation is not necessary. But how can we characterize competition when there are just two firms?</p>
<p>The easiest way to conceive of a model in which two firms compete with one another is to assume price competition, i.e., firms do not adjust their quantity choice in response to market signals, but try to set a price themselves.</p>
<p>To start, imagine a very simple setting in which two identical firms, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, produce a homogeneous good. Hence, from the perspective of consumers there is no difference in product quality between firms. Given this indifference, consumers will switch immediately upon noticing a price difference if they can buy the identical good elsewhere and if there are no frictions (such as search or information costs). Let’s further assume that both firms have zero cost of production (no fixed cost, no marginal cost), or, that they simply try to sell off a stock of a good that they have available.</p>
<p>Imagine that firm <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> sets a price <span class="math inline">\(p_A=1\)</span>. As long as consumers want to buy at that price, there is hope that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> can sell some or all of its units of the good. If so, firm <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> makes a unit profit of 1 (since fixed and marginal and hence average cost are zero).</p>
<p>But firm <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> might react. If it charges <span class="math inline">\(p_B=0.99\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(99\)</span> cents per unit), it will attract all consumers coming from <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. It is now <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> that makes the profit and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is without customers, making <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.</p>
<p>In turn, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> reacts with undercutting <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> by a small amount <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\to 0\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[p_A = p_B - \varepsilon.\]</span> Again, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> reacts to <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[p_B = p_A - \varepsilon.\]</span> These two equations are <em>reaction functions</em> or <em>best repsonse functions</em>, embodying the notion that firms react strategically to each other’s choices, and that the best each one can do is to undercut the rival.</p>

<p><a href="#fig-Bertrand" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;12.8</a> illustrates, with the strategic variables <span class="math inline">\(p_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_B\)</span> on the axes, showing two upward sloping straight lines (one blue, one red), following the <span class="math inline">\(45^\circ\)</span> diagonal (in green), and being indistinguishable owing to the assumption of a vanishing <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\to 0\)</span>. (For reasons of visibility we have left a small difference between the shown lines; in theory, as <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\to 0\)</span>, that difference would disappear).</p>
<p>Since undercutting is inherent in the game, there will be a tendency for prices to being reduced. The upper bound is where firms charge a monopoly price, <span class="math inline">\(p_m\)</span> (obviously a bit of a misnomer to call it monopoly when two firms are around), indicated by point <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. The lower bound is where no profits are being made, at 0. This is where the equilibrium can be found.

<p>A small but relevant extension is the case where both firms, while still symmetric in all respects, have constant marginal production cost of <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> and no fixed cost. Then the equilibrium is <span class="math display">\[(p_A^\star,p_B^\star)=(c,c).\]</span></p>

<p>This is the first, perhaps surprising result of the simple model named after French economist Joseph <span class="smallcaps">Bertrand</span>: two firms competing on price behave competetively and marginal cost pricing obtains in equilibrium, firms make zero profit in equilibrium. Whereas a single firm is a profit-making monopolist, adding just one firm can be enough to generate fully competitive (and hence, welfare-maximizing) outcomes. Adding a third firm would not deliver new insights.</p>

<p>The main solution concept in (non-cooperative) game theory is the <span class="smallcaps">Nash</span> equilibrium. In the present setting, both firms react optimally on each other’s presumed choices, i.e., they employ <span class="smallcaps">Nash</span> strategies. The equilibrium is there where both firms’ optimal choices are mutually consistent, so their actual choices are optimal responses to each other.

<p>The model can be extended in several importants respects.</p>
<p>One is allowing for <strong>asymmetry of marginal cost</strong>, e.g., <span class="math inline">\(c_A&gt;c_B\)</span>. This means, the profit margin is smaller for <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> than for <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, and when the price drops, the point where <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is threatened to make negative profits will be reached first. Hence, <span class="math inline">\(c_A\)</span> is the lower level of the price competition, and, in equilibrium, <span class="math display">\[(p_A^\star,p_B^\star)=(c_A,c_A).\]</span> Here, absent fixed cost, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> keeps a profit (<span class="math inline">\(p_B^\star&gt;c_B\)</span>), while <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> does not.</p>
<p>Another important extension is to allow for <strong>capacity constraints in production</strong>. Intriguingly, this changes the nature of the equilibrium. We leave this for more advanced courses.</p>

<p>As before, consider two firms <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and assume that they have the same technology and produce the same identical good. Each firm takes into account the other’s presence and decisions, but chooses unilaterally. We now consider strategic choices in terms of <em>quantities</em> where the quantitiy that firm <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> produces is set in reaction to firm <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>’s production decision. The model has been introduced by Antoine Augustin <span class="smallcaps">Cournot</span>.</p>
<p>Given that quantities are being chosen by both firms, there is in some sense an externality present: If one firm expands unilaterally its output, then the total output in the market will increase. To sell this output when the demand schedule is downward-falling, there will be a downward pressure on the price, else the total quantity cannot be sold to consumers. Consumers in turn are indifferent to buying at <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> since the the good is of identical quality in their perception. Hence, firm <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> producing more of <span class="math inline">\(q_A\)</span> while firm <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> keeps producing <span class="math inline">\(q_B\)</span> implies both <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> see their revenue fall because of the negative price effect.</p>

Numerical Example <span class="smallcaps">Cournot</span> Equilibrium
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>We set market supply <span class="math inline">\(q_A + q_B\)</span> equal to market demand (total quantity demanded <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> as a function of the price) and consider the inverse market demand <span class="math display">\[P=10 - Q = 10 - q_A - q_B.\]</span></p>
<p>The latter holds because both firms contribute to total output and the market has to clear <span class="math inline">\(Q = q_A + q_B\)</span>. The price that we see realized on the market is thus a function of the production decisions of both firms. If we view the inverse demand function as a function of <span class="math inline">\(q_A\)</span>, then the slope or derivative with respect to <span class="math inline">\(q_A\)</span> is minus one. The profit maximizing condition is again that marginal revenue must be equal to marginal cost. The marginal revenue for a firm is, as was the case for a monopoly, twice as steep as the demand function (compare <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:MRmonop}\)</span>). Hence, the coefficient on <span class="math inline">\(q_A\)</span> in the marginal revenue function is minus 2.</p>
<p>Assume marginal cost are equal across both firms and constant at 3. Equating them to marginal revenue results in the profit maximizing condition for each firm (<span class="math inline">\(MC_A=MR_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(MC_B=MR_B\)</span>). For firm <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> we obtain: <span class="math display">\[10 - 2q_A - q_B = 3.\]</span> So, the output chosen by firm <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> will be linked to the output chosen by firm <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. Hence, we say that firm <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, by taking into account the quantity decision of firm <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, reacts optimally to <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>’s choice. Again, this is a reaction function in the <span class="smallcaps">Nash</span> sense. Solving the equation for <span class="math inline">\(q_A\)</span> makes the relation between <span class="math inline">\(q_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q_B\)</span> explicit.</p>

<p>The optimal quantity produced by one firm is a negative function of the quantity produced by the other firm. We have assumed that the firms are symmetric, they are identical in terms of production technologies and in terms of cost. Hence, their chosen quantities in equilibrium coincide as well.</p>
<p>Mathematically, this system of two linear equations is very easy to solve. We start with plugging one equation into the other <span class="math display">\[q_A = \frac{1}{2} \left({7 - \left[\frac{1}{2} ({7 - q_A})\right]}\right)\]</span> and then bring all terms with <span class="math inline">\(q_A\)</span> to one side</p>

<h2 data-number="12.7" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-oligopoly"><span class="header-section-number">12.7</span> Extension to Oligopoly</h2>
<p>An oligopoly is a market configuration with a finite number <span class="math inline">\(N_f\)</span> of firms, and <span class="math inline">\(N_f&gt;1\)</span>. This covers the duopoly (<span class="math inline">\(N_f=2\)</span>), but also cases with 3 or more firms.</p>
<p>We have argued in section <a href="#sec-bertrand" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;12.5</a> that no additional insights can be had from including more firms in the analysis of the symmetric <span class="smallcaps">Bertrand</span> model. Prices will stay at marginal cost, profits will stay zero.</p>
<p>We have argued in section <a href="#sec-cournot" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;12.6</a> that a quantity-setting duopoly produces more and makes lower profits than a monopoly, but produces less and makes higher profits than competitive firms.</p>
<p>It is in this <span class="smallcaps">Cournot</span> model, where a distinction according to the number of firms can become meaningful. Intuitively, total output of all firms together will increase as <span class="math inline">\(N_f\)</span> rises. It can then be shown easily that the price needs to fall, as was the case in the duopoly setting. Profits decrease steadily but consumer and total surplus increase steadily with <span class="math inline">\(N_f\)</span>.</p>
<p>In terms of the model, each new firm adds its own reaction function to the system of <span class="math inline">\(N_f\)</span> equations, but apart from adding a bit of mathematical complexity, no structural changes occur in the model. Hence, the <span class="smallcaps">Cournot</span> oligopoly with <span class="math inline">\(N_f\)</span> firms nests as special cases: <span class="math display">\[\text{standard monopoly} \quad \text{when} \quad N_f=1\]</span> and <span class="math display">\[\text{perfect competition} \quad \text{when} \quad N_f\to \infty.\]</span></p>

<h2 data-number="13.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-risk"><span class="header-section-number">13.1</span> Risk</h2>
<p>Risk and uncertainty permeate people’s lives, and decisions need to be take in the face of risk or uncertainty. In what follows, we use risk and uncertainty interchangeably, even though it is common practice to make a distinction.</p>
<p>For modeling risk or uncertainty about a variable, consider a <em>risky prospect</em>, an uncertain but somehow quantifiable event with certain outcomes that materialize in the future. Consider two relevant dimensions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>an outcome space, and</li>
<li>a list of probabilities.</li>
</ol>
<p>Suppose you are interested in describing the risk or uncertainty of your income after graduation. Since this date will be in the future, there may be all kinds of factors influencing it, some of which you may be able to foresee or predict accurately, others that are more like random disturbances that make the prediction in its entirety somewhat inaccurate.</p>
<p>Let’s keep it simple. Say you can earn in the future either 20 or 50 (in 1,000 $), but nothing else. Then { 20, 50 } is a complete elicitation of the outcome space of future income: all possibilities that can, in theory, occur. You cannot become unemployed, you cannot become a millionaire. All outcomes are mutually exclusive, you cannot earn both 20 and 50 at the same time, and all outcomes are exogenous, thus beyond your control.</p>
<p>If you are able to assign (subjective) probabilities (or beliefs) to those distinct outcomes, like { 0.4, 0.6 }, then you are considering a situation under risk. With a chance of 40% your income will be 20, with a chance of 60%, it will be 50. The assigned, subjective probabilities, are fixed numbers for you. If you are unable to do this, then you are considering a situation under uncertainty. This definition dates back to Frank <span class="smallcaps">Knight</span> (1921).</p>
<p>We skip the philosophical discussion on whether decisionmakers are or are not able to assign these fixed probability numbers, and the deeper meaning of risk and uncertainty, but approach the issue from a practical point of view in order be able to quantify risk.</p>
<p>Note that not only is { 20,50 } a complete listing of possibilities, but the assigned probabilities add up to unity (0.4+0.6=1).</p>
<p>There is no uncertainty in any of these numbers. The uncertainty comes about by imagining a player Nature who randomly picks (draws) one of the outcome values with the associated probability. After the draw has taken place, again nothing is uncertain, because then we know what value has been drawn. In 100 draws, Nature chooses about 40 times “20” and about 60 times “50”. In infinitely many draws, “about” becomes “exactly”.</p>
<p>Hence,</p>
<ul>
<li>uncertainty and time are connected: what is uncertain <em>ex ante</em>, will be certain <em>ex post</em></li>
<li>there is incomplete information—agents need to make a decision before uncertainty is resolved.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can then refer to the risky prospect of future income as a random variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> with a known distribution, and calculate its expected value <span class="math inline">\(E(X)\)</span> as <span class="math display">\[E(X) = 20 \cdot 0.4 + 50 \cdot 0.6 = 38.\]</span> The expected value in itself is a statistic that characterizes the central location of the distribution of all possible future incomes. It is not necessarily (and not in this example) a number that is part of the list of possible outcomes. There is variation about that central number, and we can use another statistic to quantify it. That’s the variance <span class="math display">\[\text{Var}(X) = E(X^2)-E(X)^2.\]</span> Its square root is known as the standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma(X) = \sqrt{\text{Var}(X)}.\)</span> Finally, note that these statistics, or moments, are fixed numbers in themselves (<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> varies, but <span class="math inline">\(\text E (X)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\text{Var} (X)\)</span> do not).</p>
<p>In the above example, the variance is <span class="math inline">\(20^2 \cdot 0.4 + 50^2 \cdot 0.6 – 38^2 = 216\)</span> and the standard deviation is <span class="math inline">\(14.7\)</span>.</p>

<p>Choices that people make will be co-determined by their preferences. When characterizing choice in uncertain situations, special attention will be given to the concept of a ‘fair bet’, a risky prospect with an expected value of zero. Different people have different attitudes to risk: some try to avoid or shun any risk, others don’t care, others enjoy it. The risk attitude is a preference attribute, expressed by considering the willingness to accept a fair bet as <span class="math display">\[
\left. \begin{array}{rl} \text{risk averse:} &amp; \text{unwilling} \\ \text{risk neutral:} &amp; \text{indifferent} \\ \text{risk loving:} &amp; \text{willing}  \end{array} \right\} \text{to make a fair bet}
\]</span></p>
<p>Now, consider a risky prospect <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> with realizations <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, and a utility function <span class="math inline">\(u(x)\)</span>, measuring the satisfaction derived from the outcome <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Then the risk attitude is reflected in the shape of the utility function. We distinguish three canonical cases, <span class="math display">\[
\left. \begin{array}{r} \text{risk averse}  \\ \text{risk neutral}  \\ \text{risk loving}  \end{array} \right\} u \text{ is }

<p>Nicholas <span class="smallcaps">Bernoulli</span> (1687–1759) was a Swiss mathematician who described the so-called St Petersburg Paradox: a risky gamble may be refused by gamblers even though it has infinite expected gains. This possibility paved the way for the concept of diminishing marginal utility to be developed as an explanation for the paradox, and suggested by Nicholas’ cousin Daniel <span class="smallcaps">Bernoulli</span> (1700–1782). John <span class="smallcaps">von Neumann</span> (1903–1957) and Oskar <span class="smallcaps">Morgenstern</span> (1902–1977) built on this previous work to lay the axiomatic foundation for what is known in economics as expected utility theory.</p>

<p>To summarize, an agent with a concave utility function (<span class="math inline">\(u''&lt;0\)</span>) is said to be risk averse, that is, will not want to accept a mean-zero risk (fair bet) without further compensation. A risk neutral agent with a linear utility function is indifferent to risk. A risk loving agent has a convex utility function (<span class="math inline">\(u''&gt;0\)</span>) and is happy to accept a fair bet. Note that risk averse agents can be made to accept risk, if they are being compensated sufficiently.</p>

<p>Consider an example: your house is worth 160,000$, and with a probability of 90%, no damage occurs to it. If your utility function is the square root utility, then your utility of that outcome is 400.

<p>The risk attitude is reflected in the relation between the expected utility of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and the utility of <span class="math inline">\(\text{E}(X)\)</span> <span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{rc} \text{risk averse:} &amp;  u(\text{E}(X))&gt;\text{E}(u(X)) \\ \text{risk neutral:} &amp; u(\text{E}(X))=\text{E}(u(X)) \\ \text{risk loving:} &amp; u(\text{E}(X))&lt;\text{E}(u(X)) \end{array}\]</span></p>
<p>This means that to a risk averse agent, the sure thing <span class="math inline">\(\text E (X)\)</span> is worth more in utility terms than the expected utility of the risky prospect <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\text{E}(u(X))\)</span></p>
<p>In our example from <a href="#tbl-eu" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;13.1</a>, <span class="math inline">\(u(\text{E}(X)) = \sqrt{150,700} \approx 388 &lt; 385 = \text{E}(u(X))\)</span>. This is intuitive, since the square root function is strictly concave.</p>
<p>Risk averse agents will not accept a fair bet if they are not being compensated, and conversely they are willing to pay a ‘risk premium’ (RP) in order to avoid having to play the fair bet. Accordingly, risk loving agents have a negative risk premium (they pay to play) and the risk premium of risk neutral agents is zero.</p>
<p>The literatures in economics, finance, and psychology suggest that risk aversion is the most important of all risk attitudes, and we shall focus on this case in what follows. We then can ask what risk is ‘worth’ to a risk averse agent, that is, what premium would he or she pay to avoid it?</p>
<p>The risk premium can be measured as the difference between the expected value of the prospect, <span class="math inline">\(\text E(X)\)</span>, and the <em>certainty-equivalent</em> outcome <span class="math inline">\(x_c\)</span>. The latter is implicitly defined: it is a fixed number whose utility value <span class="math inline">\(u(x_c)\)</span> equals the expected utility of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}

<p>This expression can most easily be understood graphically. Consider the example of <a href="#fig-eu" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;13.2</a> where the outcomes <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> (income levels, say) are { 0 , 4 } and the probabilities are <span class="math inline">\(\pi_1=\pi_2=\pi=0.5\)</span>. Then, <span class="math inline">\(\text E X = 2\)</span>. The utility is square root. So, <span class="math inline">\(u(x_1)=0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(u(x_2)=2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\text E u(X) = 1\)</span>, whereas <span class="math inline">\(u(\text{E}(X))\approx 1.4\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note that the expected values can easily be determined graphically by connecting the two points (0,0) and (4,2) with a straight line. When <span class="math inline">\(\pi=0.5\)</span>, the location of the expected value is in the middle of that line. This gives the point (2,1) whose abscissa is <span class="math inline">\(\text{E}X\)</span> and whose ordinate is <span class="math inline">\(\text{E}u(X)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The certainty equivalent <span class="math inline">\(x_c\)</span> can be found by determining the value of <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> on the graph of <span class="math inline">\(u()\)</span> that corresponds to <span class="math inline">\(\text{E}u(X)=1\)</span>, and reading off the abscissa (<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> value). This is 1. Then the risk premium, as the difference between <span class="math inline">\(\text E X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_c\)</span> is also 1. In other words, a square-root utility agent with income prospect {0 , 4} and <span class="math inline">\(\pi=0.5\)</span> would pay 1 unit of income in order not to have to play the lottery.</p>
<p>The risk premium, hence, measures the willingness to pay for avoiding the risk. The risk premium will increase with the curvature (concavity) of the utility function <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>.</p>

<p>Quantitative measures of risk aversion, due to <span class="smallcaps">Kenneth Arrow</span> and <span class="smallcaps">John W.&nbsp;Pratt</span> are absolute and relative risk aversion. They are defined as follows</p>
<ul>
<li>absolute risk aversion <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ARA}
{\cal A}(X) \equiv - \frac{u''(X)}{u'(X)}
\end{equation}\]</span>
<ul>

</ul></li>
<li>relative risk aversion <span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\label{eq:RRA}
{\cal R}(X)   \equiv - X\cdot\frac{u''(X)}{u'(X)}  = X\cdot {\cal A}(X)

<ul>
<li>the decisionmaker considers the relative exposure to risk (say, the fraction of wealth invested in a risky as opposed to a safe asset).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Note the role of the second derivative of <span class="math inline">\(u''(X)\)</span> in the above expressions: it captures the curvature or the bendiness of the concave utility function. Compare again <a href="#fig-riskatt" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;13.1</a>. And the more curved the function is, the higher the degree of risk aversion, absolute or relative. In general, the degree of risk aversion is a local concept (as is an elasticity or a marginal rate of substitution), so that it might change with different values of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>
<p>Some known special cases are often encountered in the economics and finance literatures, are utility functions for which risk aversion stays constant with a change of wealth <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>

<h2 data-number="13.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-insurance"><span class="header-section-number">13.5</span> Insurance</h2>
<p>Risk averse agents are willing to pay for insurance since they have a positive risk premium. Insurance takes the financial risk away from the agent ex post and transfers it to the insurer, in the sense that the insurer pays the agent who suffered a loss an indemnity, a compensation payment in money. Insurance does not remove the damage risk and does not, in the first place, change the probabilities of damage occuring. Since insurance involves a contract between the insurer and the insuree, the insurer will only insure the agent if he pays a premium before any damage might occur (i.e., you cannot insure a house that is on fire).</p>
<p>Insurance can be full or partial—partial insurance involves that only part of the necessary compensation is paid in case of loss to restore utility, full insurance covers the loss fully; hence, a full insurance contract replaces the risky prospect <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> with its own expected value, <span class="math inline">\(\text{E}(X)\)</span>.</p>
<p>An insurance contract can have additional parameters besides the indemnity and the premium that are often encountered in practice. For partial insurance the following are common:</p>
<ul>
<li>deductible: insuree’s uninsured amount</li>
<li>coinsurance: percentage of loss borne by the insuree.</li>
</ul>
<p>An insurance industry may have a similar market structure as other industries, and may be competitive or non-competitive (e.g.&nbsp;monopolistic or oligopolistic). We shall assume it is competitive, so that premiums charged reflect the marginal cost of insurance. Premiums received from all insurees will determine revenue. What contributes to the cost of the insurer are in the first place the indemnities to be paid for submitted damage claims that occur with a known probability, and in the second place administration costs. If there are no administration costs, then cost equal indemnities paid. Since competition will drive expected insurance profits to zero, revenue equals cost, and hence premiums will be proportional to the probability of loss occurring. Such insurances are called <em>actuarially fair</em>: the premium is only a reflection of the true underlying chance of damage happening.</p>
<p>For such actuarially fair insurance contracts, risk averse agents want to sign a full insurance contract that obliges them to pay a premium in exchange for having the monetary consequences of a risk fully covered.</p>
<p>The pricing of such contracts uses statistical averaging. If there are many similar insured agents that <em>independently</em> experience the occurrence of a loss, then the insurer calculates the expected value of indemnities to be paid as sample average over all insurees. That is, if 150 insured agents each expect a loss of 10 with probability 20%, the expected loss per insuree is 2, and the expected aggregate loss is <span class="math inline">\(150\times 0.2 \times 10 = 300\)</span>. Nature chooses which agents will experience the loss, so that ex post on average 30 people experience a loss of 10, and submit a total damage claim of 300. The premium then is <span class="math inline">\(300/150=2\)</span>, to be paid ex ante. The insurer receives premium revenue of 300 and pays out indemnities worth 300, hence makes zero profit under competition. Assuming the insurer is risk neutral since it can spread the risk across the population, implies insurance will exist to improve the welfare of the risk averse community.</p>
<p>There are, however, important threats.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Macroeconomic shocks (pandemics, recessions, wars, etc.): if everyone in the insured population gets hit by the same shock at the same time, then the funds available for the insurer to pay out will not be sufficient to honor all claims; full insurance can typically only work if insured risks are independent; partial insurance may work if individual risks are not strongly positively correlated; but no insurance can work if the premium is based on a probability that is far lower than the actual damage rate.</li>
<li>Asymmetric information: the insuree knows more about relevant facts than the insurer.</li>
</ol>
<p>We now turn to consider the second point.</p>
<!-- SubSection........................................................ -->
</section>
<section id="sec-asinfo" class="level2" data-number="13.6">
<h2 data-number="13.6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-asinfo"><span class="header-section-number">13.6</span> Asymmetric Information Problems</h2>
<p>Consider an individual customer that bought a health insurance plan to cover financial health costs like medical treatment and medication.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Suppose people are different and have very different probabilities of contracting diseases. Further, assume a customer knows about his family’s history of diseases before signing a health insurance contract. Then if the customer pays an insurance premium which is based on averaging or <em>pooling</em> (that is, the premium is the same for every individual in the insured pool), then <em>adverse selection</em> can occur.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose, the customer chooses his health behavior after signing a contract, then the insurance cover does not provide sufficient incentive for the individual to take care or to limit cost: this can lead to <em>moral hazard</em>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In both cases, the root of the evil is the asymmetry of information. It is such that the insurer is less well informed about a crucial element, and the insuree is better informed: in case of moral hazard, the action that the insuree takes is private information for the insuree (hidden from the insurer); in case of adverse selection, the knowledge about individual circumstances is private to the insuree (hidden from the insurer).</p>
<p>As for adverse selection, the problem is that true loss probabilities differ in the population, but premium calculation ignores this fact and treats everybody the same by charging a uniform premium (this is what is meant by pooling). It is quite possible that the insurer cannot determine the individual risk, only the average risk from observed past claiming behavior. The insurer is relatively uninformed about the circumstances and risk, or the <em>type</em> of the individual.</p>
<p>Some of the good risks choose not to sign the contract because they pay more than their personal risk suggests. So the pool of insured individuals does not include those low risk people. That reduces the quality of the insurees that remain in the pool, hence the premium needs to be adjusted upward to reflect this fact. In turn, this may set off a second-round of selection of people that are relatively low risk to also leave, further deteriorating the risk pool. It is possible that the entire market unravels and no insurance contract will be offered at all in equilibrium. This phenomenon of a vicious dynamic is sometimes referred to as the ‘death spiral of adverse selection’.</p>
<p>A related, but different phenomenon can emerge when there is heterogeneity in risk aversion in the population, and individual risk aversion is negatively correlated with individual loss probabilities. In that case, the ones that have a high demand for insurance are actually the ones that are least costly to the insurer. This may lead to <em>advantageous selection</em>, and actually be a non-problem (unless it is associated with overinsurance).</p>
<p>As for moral hazard, the problem is that the contract is signed before individuals choose their <em>behavior</em>. That is, the relevant risk or claim behavior (do you take precaution, do you get vaccinated, do you wear appropriate clothing, do you submit claims exceeding the damage etc.) lies in the future and the contract cannot condition on it. The customer has again an informational advantage.</p>
<p>The literature typically distinguishes two forms of moral hazard: <em>ex ante</em> moral hazard and <em>ex post</em> moral hazard. These terms relate to when the damage occurs relative to choice of behavior. With <em>ex ante</em> moral hazard, the risk behavior is chosen before the damage can materialize. This often implies that the loss probability increases after signing the contract because the insured does not take appropriate precaution or effort to keep this probability in check (e.g.&nbsp;don’t lock you bicycle if in a hurry when you have bicycle theft insurance). Hence, the loss probability is an endogenous choice variable of the insuree and is chosen after having signed the contract with the insurer. With <em>ex post</em> moral hazard, the underlying actual loss probabilities may not necessarily change, but the size of the claims submitted may change. For instance losses that occur are exaggerated (inflated) or multiple claims are submitted for the same event. Hence, the claim size is a choice of the insuree, even if we consider the theoretical case that the insured event is associated with a loss of fixed size.</p>
<p>The consequence of either form of moral hazard is that premiums will (have to) rise for the individual, and because of pooling, also for everybody else. In other words, there is an externality present that spills over to the community at large.</p>
<p>Empirically, adverse selection and moral hazard are hard to distinguish: both imply a positive correlation of being insured and experiencing a loss. In reality, it may also occur that the insurer is better able to judge probabilities, as many individuals are overinsured (have multiple insurances for the same risk) or choose excessive cover. Much of the economics literature abstracts from such aspects. Conversely, insurers can learn one thing or other from repeated interaction with the same individuals over time. For instance, car insurance works with bonus/malus points applied to past claiming behavior (claim-free years), and hence can distinguish between the good and the bad drivers to some extent (heterogeneity in loss probabilities), or give strong incentives for ‘good claiming behavior’ (ex-post moral hazard). Private insurance markets also come up with ways of trying to ‘screen’ insurance applicants before offering a contract, and to limit moral hazard and adverse selection by offering partial insurance, so that full insurance at actuarially fair prices is unavailable.</p>
<p>In fact, real-world insurance is almost never actuarially fair, since real opportunity cost need to be incurred when insuring people. In the literature, the associated costs are called ‘loadings’, these are cost (or marginal cost) mark-ups over and above the cost associated with indemnifying claimed losses.</p>
<p>Readers are referred to the excellent survey by <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.25.1.115">Einav and Finkelstein (2011)</a> for details on how adverse selection, advantageous selection and moral hazard may be depicted in a simple demand-supply diagram, whose construction depends on underlying structural assumptions about the distribution (heterogeneity) of risk and of risk attitudes. The equilibrium, inefficiencies (welfare consequences), but also policy options will depend in addition on the size and importance of load factors. The same survey also considers ways to go beyond the simple conclusion that a positive correlation between riskiness and insurance is indicative of some sort of asymmetric information, when looking at empirical data.</p>

<h2 data-number="13.7" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-socins"><span class="header-section-number">13.7</span> Social Insurance</h2>
<p>Many real-world insurances are actually provided by the state. One good reason was alluded to in <a href="#sec-insurance" class="quarto-xref">Section&nbsp;13.5</a>: private markets often insufficiently deal with macroeconomic shocks that induce a strong positive correlation between individuals claiming. The problem surfaces when premium calculation is based on long-run average loss experiences and a specific but quite unlikely event hits unexpectedly many insured individuals at the same time. Competitive insurance markets tend to ignore this ‘tail risk’, as finance practitioners would call it, and private insurers keep insufficient buffers.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> This is illustrated by the experience of the unemployment insurance system in the United States at the point of the Covid19 outbreak in the spring of 2020, when the threat of economy-wide lockdowns was imminent. People lost their jobs on a prior unprecedented scale. Since the unemployment insurance is a government-run social insurance, the system can be propped up by the government which has recourse to debt markets and eventually to tax payers. Private insurers would become insolvent and exit the market, a private-market system would be overwhelmed and collapse.</p>
<p>Social insurances also often avail themselves of a policy parameter that is unavailable in private insurance markets: a mandate to participate. A mandate makes it obligatory for individuals to pay a premium against at least some base level of coverage, like it or not. Such mandates are known from public or publically regulated health insurance, and quite a number of income insurances such as unemployment, sickness, disability insurances or old-age retirement insurances (pensions). What a mandate tries to accomplish is to break the vicious circle that leads to gross underprovision (or unaffordability) of insurance, or even to a missing market (the ‘death spiral’ described earlier). Mandates help safeguarding equality of access to health and income insurances.</p>
<p>Whether this is a good idea or not is a priori unclear, even if mandating may mean offering insurance at lower than (inefficiently high) market prices on average. Since a mandate also implies that those who would not choose to be insured at any price are forced to spend money on a good they don’t value, mandates are hardly <span class="smallcaps">Pareto</span> improvements, so one would need to appeal to social welfare criteria that balance off the interests of the more-cheaply and voluntarily insured against those of the the involuntarily insured subgroups in the population.</p>
<p>Social insurance mandates incorporate principles of solidarity into the system in a way that private markets would not find beneficial. There are two dimensions. One is so-called <em>risk solidarity</em>, whereby insurance premiums <em>are not</em> fully differentiated according to observable risk classes, even though from an efficiency point of view (and to break the adverse selection associated with pooling) this would be called for. This can, for instance, occur where health risks are not priced differentially according to gender, even though health treatment cost could be very much gender specific. A similar argument is sometimes made in favor of keeping deductibles or elements of co-insurance low in public insurances, even though they could be used as suitable instruments to combat ex-ante moral hazard. The other dimension is <em>income solidarity</em> whereby premiums <em>are</em> differentiated according to income of the insured, typically the well-to-do paying more than the poor, even though there is no a priori reason to assume that the rich consume more health services than the poor, or make a larger claim to unemployment insurance, all else equal (including risk probabilities). Social insurance pricing is actively used for redistribution by governments around the globe, and mandates help keeping such a system in place.</p>
<p>Social insurance mandates have one additional rationale that private markets with voluntary participation tend to overlook: dealing with individuals that are boundedly rational and that will make decisions which are not in their own best interest. The present lecture notes are ill-equipped to explain the necessary detail, but evidence from economic psychologists points to many people making decisions for their own future now that they would regret to have taken when the future arrives and when they have to face the consequences of their prior actions. One example is retirement savings. Rational individuals that know or can estimate with some confidence how long they may live, can use consumption smoothing to build up savings buffers for the non-working retirement period. Compare <strong>?@sec-intertemporal</strong>. Apart from the uncertainty about how long one actually will live, the economic-psychology literature emphasizes that individuals have problems with effectively committing to long-term savings plans. It takes effort, foresight and discipline to put money aside and keep it for the old day, and to resist the temptation ‘to spend it now while you can’. A mandate that forces people into pension participation solves that issue. Interested readers that want to know more about such and related psychological aspects in public policy are referred to the relevant chapters in the excellent little book by <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/policyandchoice_book.pdf">Congdon et al (2011)</a>.</p>

<li id="fn5"><p>Please see our Math Notes <a href="https://edu.nl/atb7x#sec-sn:der2" target="_blank">for a brief review of the (partial) derivative</a><a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>For mathematically inclined readers, <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:mrs}\)</span> can be obtained when considering the total differential of the utility function, with the rate of change of utility being constrained to zero: <span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial u(x,y)}{\partial x}\text{d}x +\frac{\partial u(x,y)}{\partial y} \text{d}y= \text{d}u = 0.\]</span> The latter simply means that we keep utility constant, which is what ‘moving along’ the indifference curve really means; also see <a href="#fig-substitution" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2.10</a>. Rewriting the equation into <span class="math display">\[-\frac{\text{d}y}{\text{d}x}=\frac{\frac{\partial u(x,y)}{\partial x}}{\frac{\partial u(x,y)}{\partial y}}\]</span> gives <span class="math inline">\(MRS(x,y)\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\eqref{eq:mrs}\)</span> as the negative of the rate of change of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> upon a small change in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. That is the slope of consumption of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> seen as a function of consumption of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, see <a href="#fig-mrs" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2.11</a>. The notion of a total differential, while useful, will be explained in greater detail in more technical books.<a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>Please see our Math Notes <a href="%7B%7B%20%3C%20var%20mathnotes%20%3E%20%7D%7D#sec-ssn:graphdemand" target="_blank">that emphasize that the demand graph is quite special</a><a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>Please see our Math Notes <a href="https://edu.nl/atb7x#sec-sssn:elas" target="_blank">for a calculus-based definition of the term elasticity</a><a href="#fnref8" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p>Please see our Math Notes <a href="https://edu.nl/atb7x#tbl-tb:greek" target="_blank">for a list of Greek symbols</a><a href="#fnref9" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>Here, and elsewhere in the document, NE signifies north-east (upper right), SW south-west (lower left), and so on.<a href="#fnref10" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p>Inverse functions are properly defined for one-dimensional domains and ‘undo’ the function. Often, the notation <span class="math inline">\(f^{-1}\)</span> is used (note, ‘<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span>’ does not refer to ‘power of minus one’ in this context): <span class="math display">\[y=f(x) \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = f^{-1}(y).\]</span> Clearly, for <span class="math inline">\(f^{-1}\)</span> to be a function itself, <span class="math inline">\(f^{-1}\)</span> must uniquely map <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> onto <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> (thus, both <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f^{-1}\)</span> are one-to-one), which cannot be taken for granted for just any function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. Bearing this in mind, we then have for a strictly monotonic function <span class="math display">\[x = f^{-1}(f(x)) \qquad \text{and} \qquad y = f(f^{-1}(y)).\]</span><a href="#fnref11" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn12"><p>see our Math Notes on <a href="https://edu.nl/atb7x#sec-sn:max" target="_blank">optimization</a><a href="#fnref12" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn13"><p>Please see our Math Notes <a href="https://edu.nl/atb7x#tbl-tb:greek" target="_blank">for a list of Greek symbols</a><a href="#fnref13" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn14"><p>see our Math Notes on <a href="https://edu.nl/atb7x#sec-sn:sys" target="_blank">(linear) systems</a><a href="#fnref14" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn15"><p>Recall the concept of PPF for two private goods from the discussion around <a href="#fig-ppf" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;5.2</a>. It gives the total amount of both goods that the economy can technically produce with a fixed amount of inputs, and implies that if all inputs are used, producing more of one good means society needs to give up some of the other good. The slope of the PPF is called marginal rate of transformation.<a href="#fnref15" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn16"><p>Recall that also for purely private goods there are many <span class="smallcaps">Pareto</span> efficient allocations.<a href="#fnref16" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn17"><p>According to various sources on the internet, inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego (southern tip of South America) have a word that closely matches the stalemate situation of the prisoner’s dilemma equilibrium: ‘mamihlapinatapai’ is reported to mean ‘two people looking at each other, and each hoping the other will do what both desire but neither is willing to do (by himself)’.<a href="#fnref17" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn18"><p>We have elsewhere used the notation <span class="math inline">\(P(Q)\)</span> for inverse demand.<a href="#fnref18" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn19"><p>There is such a thing as ‘reinsurance’ in private markets, that serves as an insurance for insurance companies. This can mitigate some of the tail risk exposure of individual insurers as long as they face different insured populations, but will hardly be sufficient for big global shocks as the Covid19 pandemic.<a href="#fnref19" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
